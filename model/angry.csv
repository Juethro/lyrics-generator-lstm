"[00:12.55]Another day wasted out of time"
"[00:14.69]I can't get out of this"
"[00:16.03]Altered state of mind"
"[00:17.41]I'm going overboard"
"[00:18.75]My conscience meets decline"
"[00:20.14]Into reality"
"[00:22.26]I know this can't be fine"
"[00:24.50]Cause I'm all messed up"
"[00:26.68]Making prefect nonsense"
"[00:28.57]Drowning in my doubt too well"
"[00:32.66]Cause I'm all messed up"
"[00:34.50]Going nowhere fast but circles in my mind"
"[00:38.45]So blind"
"[00:44.59]Who are these voices in my head"
"[00:46.66]I can't go on like this"
"[00:47.94]Living like the dead"
"[00:49.33]I haven't slept so long"
"[00:50.63]Feeling sad I dread"
"[00:51.98]I'm talking to myself"
"[00:53.13]Forgot what I just said"
"[00:56.32]Cause I'm all messed up"
"[00:58.52]Making prefect nonsense"
"[01:00.49]Drowning in my doubt too well"
"[01:04.01]Cause I'm all messed up"
"[01:06.32]Going nowhere fast but circles in my mind"
"[01:10.33]So blind"
"[01:16.49]Well I hold my only enemy as closely as a friend"
"[01:21.65]And I sold my own reality to further my descent"
"[01:26.95]Self-destruction taking over it's so easy to pretend"
"[01:31.83]Introduction to this nightmare may never end"
"[02:02.40]Can anyone help me drag my heels"
"[02:04.67]I'm running overtime"
"[02:05.73]I can't hold down my meals"
"[02:07.38]My mind is racing by"
"[02:08.43]Staring blankly feels"
"[02:10.71]Like pulling out my teeth"
"[02:11.77]While this engine winds"
"[02:15.00]Cause I'm all messed up"
"[02:16.77]Making prefect nonsense"
"[02:19.53]Drowning in my doubt too well"
"[02:22.36]Cause I'm all messed up"
"[02:24.51]Going nowhere fast but circles in my mind"
"[02:28.35]So blind"
"[00:09.70]Decaying’ ever faster."
"[00:12.50]Under wear all the imminent disaster"
"[00:15.24]Open up your eyes."
"[00:17.11]As you ruminate the hopeless ends of time."
"[00:22.67]Did you wander out your days lost and resigned?"
"[00:28.00]Or recreate the universes in your mind?"
"[00:38.04]Everybody is a bastard"
"[00:40.70]The world is, like plaster."
"[00:43.38]Crumblin’ apart from pressure of the blaster, waiting for a sign.[00:48.32]And the momentary pleasures take their turn,"
"[00:54.07]As the wistful boy runs out of things to learn."
"[00:59.30]The episodes of your are never to return."
"[01:05.98]Scare up some hope,"
"[01:08.49]You’re gonna need it just to cope,"
"[01:10.92]You are the decision, numbers don’t rely."
"[01:17.75]When you bite the dust,"
"[01:19.63]Wasn’t the purpose all for trust,"
"[01:22.55]You’ll never relive it,"
"[01:24.93]Think before you die."
"[01:28.57]Yeah, think, think before you die."
"[01:34.08]"
"[01:46.69]Deficit and depravation,"
"[01:49.47]In the wake of desperation."
"[01:51.93]We write the morals rectify the nation,"
"[01:54.76]Now may be a time."
"[01:57.10]As you ruminate the hopeless ends of time,"
"[02:02.82]Do you wonder how your life has been defined?"
"[02:07.95]You know eternity can’t ever change your mind."
"[02:13.78]You know eternity can’t ever change your mind."
"[02:19.50]So, think, think before you die."
"[02:25.32]Whoa, think, think before you die."
"[02:30.76]"
"[00:08.94]Finally I felt the calming breeze"
"[00:17.62]Stepping out to watch the final scene."
"[00:26.47]After all it’s you, my pride, and me."
"[00:35.16]I can speak whatever I can speak."
"[00:43.08]You see."
"[01:04.97]"
"[01:07.74]Now I found the way to meet the means."
"[01:15.67]Faker face to make the kingdom clean."
"[01:23.57]After all it’s me, the king, and the beast."
"[01:31.38]Whatever… whatever… I can’t speak"
"[01:38.63]A thing."
"[01:59.42]"
"[02:02.94]How can I explain my winded feet?"
"[02:10.76]Cut them off in 2nd Mark it seems."
"[02:18.55]Cut me off before I start to see."
"[02:26.41]But I can cry as long as my deceit."
"[02:33.69]You see?"
"[02:37.92]Me."
"[02:41.68]See."

"[04:16.00]Oh"
"[04:24.00]On I burn"
"[00:02.61]when we were making the first Linkin Park record"
"[00:04.68]He was like,"
"[00:05.65]""Yeah you know, I don't know about the rapping like,"
"[00:08.15]I don't know... maybe you should just be a rock band."""
"[00:11.05]You know what I mean, like, trying to change us"
"[00:12.71]like they signed us as an act like what we sound like and then he's like"
"[00:16.18]""Oh I don't know maybe you should just play keyboard"""
"[00:18.87]"
"[00:20.09]Before the first song that you heard me on"
"[00:22.37]There were people already tryin' to get me gone"
"[00:24.71]Tellin' me to quit rapping"
"[00:25.98]""Just play the keys"""
"[00:27.15]That my band had a singer"
"[00:28.46]They didn't need me"
"[00:29.53]But my band had my back"
"[00:30.71]So we did the tracks"
"[00:32.28]Put out the album and the talk went flat"
"[00:34.31]It was funny at first but then the humour faded"
"[00:36.71]When some magazines printed that our label made us"
"[00:39.55]We were to be good to be true"
"[00:40.86]Some were saying ghost writers were writin' all that we do"
"[00:43.80]So we had to disprove it"
"[00:45.42]We spelled it out to the detail how we do it when we're making this music"
"[00:49.00]After that I made it a rule"
"[00:50.74]I only do e-mail responses to print interviews"
"[00:53.37]Because these people love to put a twist to your words"
"[00:56.03]To infer that you said something fucking absurd"
"[00:58.17]"
"[00:58.84]Oh, did I lose you at infer?"
"[01:00.78]Not used to hearing a verse that uses over first grade vocabulary words?"
"[01:05.47]People used to infer that we were manufactured"
"[01:08.50]Now I've got the interviews on file"
"[01:10.29]Which people said what"
"[01:11.67]Which number to dial"
"[01:12.63]So now every enemy screaming insanity"
"[01:15.29]All they're ever gonna be's another big fan of me"

"[00:20.93]Lately I really, feel like I'm rolling for ___ like Philly,"
"[00:24.86]I feel like I'm losing control of myself, I sincerely,"
"[00:27.56]I apologize if all that I sound like, is I'm complaining,"
"[00:30.96]But life keeps on complicating, an' I'm debating,"
"[00:32.96]On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls,"
"[00:36.22]Can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it,"
"[00:38.08]But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty,"
"[00:40.68]When inside, I'm dying, I am finally realizing I need help."
"[00:44.12]I can't do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I've been having ups and downs,"
"[00:48.15]Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying,"
"[00:50.35]Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here."
"[00:53.77]I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight mirrors,"
"[00:57.60]I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?"
"[01:01.59]I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie,"
"[01:04.38]I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her,"
"[01:07.25]Shit.."

"[01:07.82]I'm going through changes"
"[01:15.60]I'm going through changes"
"[01:20.04]"
"[01:22.36]I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon,"
"[01:25.28]Yeah dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you."
"[01:27.98]Marshall what happened at you, you can't stop with these pills,"
"[01:31.03]And you've fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughin' at you."
"[01:33.57]It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up,"
"[01:36.50]Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled."
"[01:39.63]Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed,"
"[01:42.03]They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust,"
"[01:44.67]Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that,"
"[01:46.99]He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, no-body, he fights first,"
"[01:49.93]But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse,"
"[01:51.68]Now I'm poppin Vic's, perks and Methadone pills."
"[01:54.75]Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it,"
"[01:56.76]Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like ""yes man"","
"[01:59.46]And they gon' do whatever I says when, I says it,"

"[02:24.49]My friends just can't understand this new me,"
"[02:26.45]That's understandable man, but just think how bananas you'd be,"
"[02:29.14]You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo."
"[02:33.53]And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do,"
"[02:36.52]I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is,"
"[02:39.26]Fame startin' to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low."
"[02:42.65]I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin' the same damn DVD,"
"[02:46.58]Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive."
"[02:49.35]And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin' pills'll make me feel alright."
"[02:52.79]And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night,"
"[02:55.23]I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin' right,"
"[02:57.98]I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound."

"[03:29.77]Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof."
"[03:31.84]I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few,"
"[03:34.60]Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth."
"[03:37.39]shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through?"
"[03:40.16]I think about the things I would never got to say to you,"
"[03:42.87]I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do."
"[03:45.76]Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too,"
"[03:48.52]I still love your mother, that'll never change,"

"[04:10.95]I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history,"
"[04:13.64]But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say,"
"[04:16.47]I miss you self consciously, wish it didn't end this way."

"[01:34.57]No matter what you say nothing ′s gonna change my mind."
"[01:48.99]Can′t pretend on doubt until the end."

"[00:33.22]"
"[00:39.15]Gather round me people there's a story I would tell"
"[00:43.34]"
"[00:44.47]About a brave young Indian you should remember well"
"[00:49.25]From the tribe of the Pima Indian"
"[00:52.43]A proud and peaceful band"
"[00:54.99]Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land"
"[01:00.81]Down the ditches for a thousand years"
"[01:03.04]The water grew Ira's peoples' crops"
"[01:05.79]'Till the white man stole the water rights"
"[01:08.35]And the sparklin' water stopped"
"[01:11.59]Now Ira's folks were hungry"
"[01:13.98]And their land grew crops of weeds"
"[01:16.49]When war came, Ira volunteered"
"[01:19.39]And forgot the white man's greed"
"[01:22.81]Call him drunken Ira Hayes"
"[01:25.62]He won't answer anymore"
"[01:28.37]Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian"
"[01:30.93]Nor the Marine that went to war"
"[01:34.35]"
"[01:36.54]There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill,"
"[01:39.85]Two hundred and fifty men"
"[01:42.34]But only twenty-seven lived to fight back down again"
"[01:47.53]And when the fight was over"
"[01:50.26]And when Old Glory raised"
"[01:52.71]Among the men who held it high"
"[01:55.27]Was the Indian, Ira Hayes"

"[02:11.14]Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian"

"[02:17.25]"
"[02:22.06]Ira returned a hero"
"[02:25.05]Celebrated through the land"
"[02:27.50]He was wined and speeched and honored;"
"[02:30.39]Everybody shook his hand"
"[02:32.63]But he was just a Pima Indian"
"[02:35.63]No water, no crops, no chance"
"[02:38.16]At home nobody cared what Ira'd done"
"[02:41.07]And when did the Indians dance"
"[02:43.00]"
"[02:44.39]Call him drunken Ira Hayes"

"[02:49.87]Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian"

"[02:57.99]Then Ira started drinkin' hard;"
"[03:00.42]"
"[03:00.99]Jail was often his home"
"[03:03.47]They'd let him raise the flag and lower it"
"[03:05.92]like you'd throw a dog a bone!"
"[03:09.32]"
"[03:11.01]He died drunk early one mornin'"
"[03:14.33]Alone in the land he fought to save"
"[03:16.83]Two inches of water in a lonely ditch"
"[03:19.02]Was a grave for Ira Hayes"
"[03:21.52]"
"[03:22.57]Call him drunken Ira Hayes"
"[03:25.12]He won't answer anymore"

"[03:33.81]"
"[03:35.42]Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes"
