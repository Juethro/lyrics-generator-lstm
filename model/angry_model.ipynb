so caught in it I almost feel I\\'m the one who caused it \\n This ain\\'t what I\\'m in hip-hop for, it\\'s not why I got in it \\n That was never my object for someone to get killed \\n Why would I wanna destroy something I help build \\n It wasn\\'t my intentions, my intentions was good \\n I went through my whole career without ever mentionin\\' (?) \\n Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn\\'t my beef \\n So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth \\n While he\\'s all over t.v. down talkin\\' a man who literally saved my life \\n Like fuck it i understand this is

him not to start it he wasn\\'t gonna go after him \\n Until Ja started yappin\\' in magazines how we stabbed him \\n Fuck it 50 smash \\'em, mash \\'em and let him have it \\n Meanwhile my attention is pullin\\' in other directions \\n Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk \\n Has an erection for me and thinks that I\\'ll be his ressurection \\n Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record \\n But now he\\'s fucked the game up cuz one of the ways I came up \\n Was through that publication the same one that made me famous \\n Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin\\' \\n Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then \\n But I\\'m so busy being pissed off I don\\'t stop to think \\n That we just inherited 50\\'s beef

is \\n To have run ya nav and who sulked us up in our corners \\n Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is \\n But I ain\\'t tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered \\n There ain\\'t words that I can\\'t think of a perfecter way to word it \\n Then to just say that I love ya\\'ll too much to see the virdict \\n I\\'ll walk away from it all before I let it go any further \\n But don\\'t get it twisted, it\\'s not a plea that I\\'m coppin\\' \\n I\\'m just willin\\' to be the bigger man \\n If ya\\'ll can quit poppin\\' off at your jaws with the knockin\\' \\n Cuz frankly

\\n He won\\'t answer anymore \\n Not the whiskey drinkin\\' Indian \\n Nor the Marine that went to war \\n  \\n Gather round me people there\\'s a story I would tell \\n  \\n About a brave young Indian you should remember well \\n From the tribe of the Pima Indian \\n A proud and peaceful band \\n Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land \\n Down the ditches for a thousand years \\n The water grew Ira\\'s peoples\\' crops \\n \\'Till the white man stole the water rights \\n And the sparklin\\' water stopped \\n Now Ira\\'s folks were hungry \\n And their land grew crops of weeds \\n When war came, Ira volunteered \\n And forgot the white man\\'s greed \\n Call him drunken Ira Hayes \\n He won\\'t answer anymore \\n Not the whiskey drinkin\\' Indian \\n Nor the Marine that went to war \\n  \\n There they battled up Iwo Jima\\'s hill, \\n Two hundred and fifty men \\n But only twenty-seven lived to fight back down again \\n And when the fight was over \\n And when Old Glory raised \\n Among the men who held it high \\n Was the Indian, Ira Hayes \\n  \\n Call him drunken Ira Hayes \\n He won\\'t answer anymore \\n Not the whiskey drinkin\\' Indian \\n Nor the Marine that went to war \\n  \\n Ira returned a hero \\n Celebrated through the land \\n He was wined and speeched and honored; \\n Everybody shook his hand \\n But he was just a Pima Indian \\n No water, no crops, no chance \\n At home nobody cared what Ira\\'d done \\n And when did the Indians dance \\n  \\n Call him drunken Ira Hayes \\n He won\\'t answer anymore \\n Not the whiskey drinkin\\' Indian \\n Nor the Marine that went to war \\n  \\n Then Ira started drinkin\\' hard; \\n  \\n Jail was often his home \\n They\\'d let him raise the flag and lower it \\n like you\\'d throw a dog a bone! \\n  \\n He died drunk early one mornin\\' \\n Alone in the land he fought to save \\n Two inches of water in a lonely ditch \\n Was a grave for Ira Hayes \\n  \\n Call him drunken Ira Hayes \\n He won\\'t answer anymore \\n Not the whiskey drinkin\\' Indian \\n Nor the Marine that went to war \\n  \\n Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes \\n  \\n But his land is just as dry \\n And his ghost is lyin\\' thirsty \\n In the ditch where Ira died \\n Decaying’ ever faster. \\n Under wear all the imminent disaster \\n Open up your eyes. \\n As you ruminate the hopeless ends of time. \\n Did you

heard me on \\n There were people already tryin\\' to get me gone \\n Tellin\\' me to quit rapping \\n \"Just play the keys\" \\n That my band had a singer \\n They didn\\'t need me \\n But my band had my back \\n So we did the tracks \\n Put out the album and the talk went flat \\n It was funny at first but then the humour faded \\n When some magazines printed that our label made us \\n We were to be good to be true \\n Some were saying ghost writers were writin\\' all that we do \\n So we had to disprove it \\n We spelled it out to the detail how we do it when we\\'re making this music \\n After that I made it a rule \\n I only do e-mail responses to print interviews \\n Because these people love to put a twist to your words \\n To infer that you said something fucking absurd \\n  \\n Oh, did I lose you at infer? \\n Not used to hearing a verse that uses over first grade vocabulary words? \\n People used to infer that we were manufactured \\n Now I\\'ve got the interviews on file

grievin\\', I try and hide it, \\n But I can\\'t, why do I act like I\\'m all high and mighty, \\n When inside, I\\'m dying, I am finally realizing I need help. \\n I can\\'t do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I\\'ve been having ups and downs, \\n Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying, \\n Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here. \\n I\\'m hatin\\' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin\\' to fight mirrors, \\n I can\\'t stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care? \\n I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie, \\n I\\'m afraid if I close my eyes I might see her, \\n Shit.. \\n  \\n I\\'m going through changes \\n I\\'m going through changes \\n  \\n I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin\\' at noon, \\n Yeah dad\\'s in a bad mood, he\\'s always snappin\\' at you. \\n Marshall what happened at you, you can\\'t stop with these pills, \\n And you\\'ve fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughin\\' at you. \\n It become a problem you\\'re too pussy to tackle, get up, \\n Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled. \\n Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed, \\n They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust, \\n Nah, it ain\\'t like Doody to do that, \\n He wouldn\\'t fuckin\\' shoot at, no-body, he fights first, \\n But dwellin\\' on it only makes the night worse, \\n Now I\\'m poppin Vic\\'s, perks and Methadone pills. \\n Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it, \\n Fuckin\\' drug dealers hang around me like \"yes man\", \\n And they gon\\' do whatever I says when, I says it, \\n It\\'s in their best interest to protect their investment. \\n And I just lost my fuckin\\' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then... \\n  \\n I\\'m going through changes \\n Don\\'t know what I\\'m going through, but I just keep on going through changes... \\n  \\n My friends just can\\'t understand this new me, \\n That\\'s understandable man, but just think how bananas you\\'d be, \\n You\\'d be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo. \\n And everybody\\'s lookin\\' at you, what you want me to do, \\n I\\'m startin\\' to live like a recluse and the truth is, \\n Fame startin\\' to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low. \\n I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin\\' the same damn DVD, \\n Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive. \\n And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin\\' pills\\'ll make me feel alright. \\n And if I\\'m still awake in the middle of the night, \\n I just take a couple more, yeah you\\'re motherfuckin\\' right, \\n I ain\\'t slowin\\' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound. \\n Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on, don\\'t look now, \\n Daddy, don\\'t you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground. \\n Fuck, don\\'t I know the sound of that voice, \\n Yeah baby hold me down. \\n  \\n I\\'m going through changes \\n Don\\'t know what I\\'m going through, but I just keep on going through changes... \\n  \\n Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, plus somehow I\\'m pullin\\' through. \\n Swear when I come back I\\'ma be bulletproof. \\n I\\'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few, \\n Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth. \\n shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through? \\n I think about the things I would never got to say to you, \\n I\\'d never get to make it right, so here\\'s what I came to do. \\n Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too, \\n I still love your mother, that\\'ll never change, \\n Think about her every day, we just could never get it together. \\n Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it, \\n But I swear on everything, I\\'d do anything for her on anyday. \\n There are just too many things, to explain, when it rains, \\n Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn\\'t any pain. \\n But I can\\'t pretend there ain\\'t, I ain\\'t placin\\' any blame, \\n I ain\\'t pointin\\' fingers, heaven knows there never been a saint. \\n I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history, \\n But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say, \\n I miss you self consciously, wish it didn\\'t end this way. \\n But I just had to get away, don\\'t know why, \\n I don\\'t know what else to say, I guess I\\'m.. \\n  \\n I\\'m going through changes \\n Don\\'t know what I\\'m going through, but I just keep on going through changes... \\n  \\n Eminem - Going Through Changes \\n  \\n END... ... \\n What you see\\'s not what you get
