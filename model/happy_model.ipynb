wish we could just pretend \\n Even if for only one weekend \\n So come on, Tell me \\n Is this the end? \\n  \\n Drinkin\\' tea in bed \\n Watching DVD\\'s \\n When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines \\n You take me out shopping and all we\\'d buy is trainers \\n As if we ever needed anything to entertain us \\n the first time that you introduced me to your friends \\n and you could tell I was nervous, so you held my hand \\n when I was feeling down, you made that face you do \\n no one in the world that could replace you \\n  \\n Dreams, Dreams \\n Of when we had just started things

\\n I don\\'t understand your reasons \\n Please just stay over the weekend \\n You can\\'t take all those things \\n They define you and me \\n everything we\\'ve become, \\n You\\'re all that I need \\n Please don\\'t make me face my generation alone. \\n . \\n All the pretty girls on a Saturday night. \\n Let it be, and come with me with the look in your eyes. \\n Will you break and take all the words from my mouth? \\n I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down. \\n But not you, \\n . \\n I feel your faith is destroying the world \\n and then this one never really understood \\n the 80s is over and done \\n Oh c\\'mon, what\\'s a boy to do, \\n when all the pretty girls can\\'t measure to you? \\n ALL THE PRETTY GIRLS LYRICS - FUN. \\n  \\n Honey lovin you is the greatest thing

livin out the life of a poet \\n I am the jester in the ancient court \\n You’re the funny little frog in my throat \\n My eye sight’s fading, my hearing’s dim \\n I can’t get insured for the state I’m in \\n I’m a danger to myself I’ve been starting fights \\n At the party at the club on a Saturday night \\n But I don’t get disapproving from my girl \\n She gets the all highlights wrapped in pearls.. \\n You’re my picture on the wall \\n You’re my vision in the hall \\n You’re the one I’m talking to \\n When I get in from my work \\n You are my girl, and you don’t even know it \\n I am livin out the life of a poet \\n I am the jester in the ancient court \\n You’re the funny little frog in my throat \\n I had a conversation with you at night \\n It’s a little one sided but that’s allright \\n I tell you in the kitchen about my day \\n You sit on the bed in the dark changing places \\n With the ghost that was there before you came \\n You’ve come to save my life again \\n I don’t dare to touch your hand \\n I don’t dare to think of you \\n In a physical way \\n And I don’t know how you smell \\n You are the cover of my magazine \\n You’re my fashion tip, a living museum \\n I’d pay to visit you on rainy Sundays \\n I’ll maybe tell you all about it someday \\n  \\n We could go to the cinema \\n Big effects and big named stars \\n And we can go to that private view \\n But darling these days my favorite view is you \\n Lets just bend the invitation \\n And leave our bikes down at the station \\n Lose our sense of direction \\n There’s nothing here to lose \\n  \\n Oh you will run \\n Come get lost with me \\n Slip away discreetly \\n You’re my love \\n So come away with me \\n Lets get lost till empty \\n  \\n We could stay here till closing time \\n But the drinks are flat and the price is a crime \\n We could dance till our feet turn red \\n But the beats so boring \\n And I’d rather be home in our bed \\n  \\n This towns skipping like a record \\n Reruns get me so bored \\n So with enough that I can afford \\n Lets get lost \\n Again \\n  \\n Yeah we will run \\n Come get lost with me \\n Slip away discreetly \\n You’re my love \\n Come get lost with me \\n Till we run on empty \\n  \\n Lets go \\n Lets go \\n You’re my love come get lost with me \\n You’re my love come till empty \\n Lets go \\n Sometimes the sun shines on us \\n Sometimes the rain goes and a rainbow’s all that’s left \\n We got lucky, hey, didn’t we, baby? \\n  \\n ‘Cause I like your head on my shoulder \\n I like the way you smile, the way you smile oh oh \\n We both think the weather’s getting better \\n So let’s get lucky, let’s go all the way \\n  \\n I found you seaside in the fog \\n I hadn’t tried a lot of looking for anything at all \\n The
