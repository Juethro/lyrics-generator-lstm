gone \\n Can\\'t turn back now \\n I\\'m haunted \\n  \\n Stood there and watched you walk away \\n From everything we had \\n But I still mean every word I said to you \\n He will try to take away my pain \\n And he just might make me smile \\n But the whole time I\\'m wishing he was you instead \\n Oh, holding my breath \\n Woah, see you again \\n Something keeps me holding onto nothing \\n  \\n C\\'mon, c\\'mon don\\'t leave me like this \\n I thought I had you figured out \\n Something\\'s gone terribly wrong \\n You\\'re all I wanted \\n C\\'mon, c\\'mon don\\'t leave me like this \\n I thought I had you figured out \\n Can\\'t breathe whenever you\\'re gone \\n Can\\'t turn back now \\n I\\'m haunted \\n  \\n I know, I know \\n I just know \\n You\\'re not gone \\n You can\\'t be gone, no \\n  \\n C\\'mon, c\\'mon don\\'t leave me like this \\n I thought I had you figured out \\n Something\\'s gone terribly wrong \\n Won\\'t finish what you started \\n C\\'mon, c\\'mon don\\'t leave me like this \\n I thought I had you figured out \\n Can\\'t breathe whenever you\\'re gone \\n Can\\'t go back \\n I\\'m haunted \\n Oh... Oh... \\n You and I walk a fragile line \\n I have known it all this time \\n Never ever thought I\\'d see it break \\n Never thought I\\'d see it \\n  \\n I fought for you \\n The hardest, it made me the strongest \\n So tell me your secrets \\n I just can\\'t stand to see you leaving \\n  \\n But heaven couldn\\'t wait for you \\n No heaven couldn\\'t wait for you \\n Heaven couldn\\'t wait for you \\n No heaven couldn\\'t wait for you \\n So go on, go home \\n  \\n We laughed at the darkness \\n So scared that we lost it \\n We stood on the ceilings \\n You showed me love was all you needed \\n  \\n heaven couldn\\'t wait for you \\n heaven couldn\\'t wait for you \\n Heaven couldn\\'t wait for you \\n No heaven couldn\\'t wait for you \\n Heaven couldn\\'t wait for you \\n  \\n heaven couldn\\'t wait for you \\n No heaven couldn\\'t wait for you \\n Heaven couldn\\'t wait for you \\n So go on, go home \\n  \\n So go on, go home \\n  \\n Once I dreamed that love would come and sweep me up away \\n Now it seems life\\'s passed me by, I\\'m still alone today \\n Here come the tears \\n  \\n Looks like it\\'ll always be the same \\n No one here to comfort me \\n Here come the tears \\n  \\n All alone, no one cares \\n So much to give to you all out there \\n  \\n Take me now, in your arms \\n Let me rest, safe from harm \\n  \\n Ohhh.... I want to be loved \\n I need to be loved \\n Won\\'t somebody love me \\n  \\n Here Comes The Tears \\n Judas Priest \\n Sin After Sin \\n  \\n Here they come, here come the tears \\n  \\n Here come the tears \\n  \\n Well, a person can work up a mean, mean thirst \\n  \\n After a hard day of nothin\\' much at all \\n  \\n Summer\\'s passed, it\\'s too late to cut the grass \\n  \\n There ain\\'t much to rake anyway in the fall \\n  \\n And sometimes I just ain\\'t in the mood \\n  \\n To take my place in back with the loudmouths \\n  \\n You\\'re like a picture on the fridge that\\'s never stocked with food \\n  \\n I used to live at home, now I stay at the house \\n  \\n And everybody wants to be special here \\n  \\n They call your name out loud and clear \\n Here comes a regular \\n  \\n Call out your name \\n  \\n Here comes a regular \\n  \\n Am I the only one here today? \\n  \\n Well, a drinkin\\' buddy that\\'s bound to another town \\n  \\n Once the police made you go away \\n  \\n And even if you\\'re in the arms of someone\\'s baby now \\n  \\n I\\'ll take a great big whiskey to you anyway \\n  \\n And everybody wants to be someone\\'s here \\n  \\n Someone\\'s gonna show up, never fear \\n \\'Cause here comes a regular \\n  \\n Call out your name \\n  \\n Yes, now here comes a regular \\n  \\n Am I the only one who feels ashamed? \\n  \\n Kneeling alongside old Sad Eyes \\n  \\n He says, \"Opportunity knocks once, then the door slams shut\" \\n  \\n All I know is I\\'m sick of everything that my money can buy \\n  \\n The fool who wastes his life, God rest his guts \\n  \\n First the lights, then the collar goes up and the wind begins to blow \\n  \\n Turn your back on a pay-you-back, last call \\n  \\n First the glass, then the leaves that pass, then comes the snow \\n  \\n Ain\\'t much to rake anyway in the fall \\n A hundred days have made me older \\n Since the last time that I saw your pretty face \\n  \\n A thousand lies have made me colder \\n And I don\\'t think I can look at this the same \\n  \\n All the miles that separate \\n Disappear now when I\\'m dreamin\\' of your face \\n  \\n I\\'m here without you baby \\n But you\\'re still on my lonely mind \\n I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time \\n I\\'m here without you baby \\n But you\\'re still with me in my dreams \\n And tonight, there\\'s only you and me. \\n  \\n The miles just keep rollin\\' \\n As the people leave their way to say hello \\n  \\n I\\'ve heard this life is overrated \\n But I hope that it gets better as we go. \\n  \\n I\\'m here without you baby \\n But you\\'re still on my lonely mind \\n I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time \\n I\\'m here without you baby \\n But you\\'re still with me in my dreams \\n And tonight girl, there\\'s only you and me. \\n Everything I know, and anywhere I go \\n It gets hard but it won\\'t take away my love \\n And when the last one falls, when it\\'s all said and done. \\n It gets hard but it won\\'t take away my love \\n  \\n I\\'m here without you baby \\n But you\\'re still on my lonely mind \\n I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time \\n I\\'m here without you baby \\n But you\\'re still with me in my dreams \\n And tonight girl, there\\'s only you and me \\n  \\n There\\'s a hero \\n If you look inside your heart \\n You don\\'t have to be afraid \\n Of what you are \\n There\\'s an answer \\n If you reach into your soul \\n And the sorrow that you know \\n Will melt away \\n And then a hero comes along \\n With the strength to carry on \\n And you cast your fears aside \\n And you know you can survive \\n So when you feel like hope is gone \\n Look inside you and be strong \\n And you\\'ll finally see the truth \\n That a hero lies in you \\n  \\n It\\'s a long road \\n When you face the world alone \\n No one reaches out a hand \\n For you to hold \\n You can find love \\n If you search within yourself \\n And the emptiness you felt \\n Will disappear \\n And then a hero comes along \\n With the strength to carry on \\n And you cast your fears aside \\n And you know you can survive \\n So when you feel like hope is gone \\n Look inside you and be strong \\n And you\\'ll finally see the truth \\n That a hero lies in you \\n Lord knows \\n Dreams are hard to follow \\n But don\\'t let anyone \\n Tear them away \\n There will be tomorrow \\n In time \\n You\\'ll find the way \\n And then a hero comes along \\n With the strength to carry on \\n And you cast your fears aside \\n And you know you can survive \\n So when you feel like hope is gone \\n Look inside you and be strong \\n And you\\'ll finally see the truth \\n That a hero lies in you \\n That a hero lies in you \\n  \\n That a hero lies in you \\n  \\n Got no place to go \\n But there\\'s a girl waiting for me down in Mexico \\n She got a bottle of tequila, a bottle of gin \\n And if I bring a little music I could fit right in \\n  \\n We got airplane rides \\n We got California drowning out the window side \\n We\\'ve got big black cars \\n And we got stories how we slept with all the \\n Movie stars \\n  \\n I may take a holiday in Spain \\n Leave my wings behind me \\n Drink my worries down the drain \\n And fly away to somewhere new \\n  \\n Hop on my choo-choo \\n I\\'ll be your engine driver in a bunny suit \\n If you dress me up in pink and white \\n We may be just a little fuzzy \\'bout it later tonight \\n  \\n She\\'s my angel \\n She\\'s a little better than the one that used to be with me \\n Cause she liked to scream at me \\n Man, it\\'s a miracle that she\\'s not living up in a tree \\n  \\n I may take a holiday in Spain \\n Leave my wings behind me \\n Drive this little girl insane \\n And fly away to someone new \\n  \\n Everybody\\'s gone \\n They left the television screaming that the radio\\'s on \\n Someone stole my shoes \\n But there\\'s a couple of bananas \\n And a bottle of booze \\n  \\n Oh well, happy new year\\'s baby! \\n We could probably fix it if we clean it up all day \\n Or we could simply pack our bags \\n And catch a plane to Barcelona \\'cause this city\\'s a drag \\n  \\n I may take a holiday in Spain \\n Leave my wings behind me \\n Flush my worries down the drain \\n And fly away to somewhere new \\n  \\n Take a holiday in Spain \\n Leave my wings behind me \\n Drive this little girl insane \\n Fly away to someone new \\n Fly away to someone new \\n Fly away to someone new \\n  \\n Another summer day \\n Is come and gone away \\n In Paris and Rome \\n But I wanna go home \\n  \\n Maybe surrounded by \\n A million people I \\n Still feel all alone \\n I just wanna go home \\n Oh I miss you, you know \\n  \\n And I\\'ve been keeping \\n all the letters that I wrote to you \\n Each one a line or two \\n I\\'m fine baby, how are you \\n Well I would send them but \\n I know that it\\'s just not enough \\n My words were cold and flat \\n And you deserve more than that \\n  \\n Another aerorplane \\n Another sunny place \\n I\\'m lucky I know \\n But I wanna go home \\n Mmmm, I\\'ve got to go home \\n  \\n Let me go home \\n I\\'m just too far from where you are \\n I wanna come home \\n  \\n And I feel just like \\n I\\'m living someone else\\'s life \\n It\\'s like I just stepped outside \\n When everything was going right \\n And I know just why you could not \\n Come along with me \\n But this was not your dream \\n But you always believe in me \\n  \\n Another winter day has come \\n And gone away \\n And even Paris and Rome \\n And I wanna go home \\n Let me go home \\n  \\n And I\\'m surrounded by \\n A million people I \\n Still feel alone \\n Oh, let go home \\n Oh, I miss you, you know \\n  \\n Let me go home \\n I\\'ve had my run \\n Baby, I\\'m done \\n I gotta go home \\n Let me go home \\n It will all right \\n I\\'ll be home tonight \\n I\\'m coming back home \\n  \\n Hope there\\'s someone \\n Who\\'ll take care of me \\n When I die, will I go \\n  \\n Hope there\\'s someone \\n Who\\'ll set my heart free \\n Nice to hold when I\\'m tired \\n  \\n There\\'s a ghost on the horizon \\n When I go to bed \\n How can I fall asleep at night \\n How will I rest my head \\n  \\n Oh I\\'m scared of the middle place \\n Between light and nowhere \\n I don\\'t want to be the one \\n Left in there, left in there \\n  \\n There\\'s a man on the horizon \\n Wish that I\\'d go to bed \\n If I fall to his feet tonight \\n Will allow rest my head \\n  \\n So here\\'s hoping I will not drown \\n Or paralyze in light \\n And godsend I don\\'t want to go \\n To the seal\\'s watershed \\n  \\n Hope there\\'s someone \\n Who\\'ll take care of me \\n When I die, Will I go \\n  \\n Hope there\\'s someone \\n Who\\'ll set my heart free \\n Nice to hold when I\\'m tired \\n How can I forget your love? \\n How can I never see you again? \\n There’s a time and place \\n For one more sweet embrace \\n And there’s a time, ooh \\n When it all, ooh \\n Went wrong \\n I guess you know by now \\n That we will meet again somehow \\n  \\n Oh, oh, oh baby \\n How can I begin again? \\n How can I try to love someone new? \\n Someone who isn’t you \\n How can our love be true? \\n When I’m not, ooh \\n I’m not over you \\n I guess you know by now \\n That we will meet again somehow \\n  \\n Time can come and take away the pain \\n But I just want my memories to remain \\n To hear your voice \\n To see your face \\n There’s not one moment I’d erase \\n You are a guest here now \\n  \\n So baby \\n How can I forget your love? \\n How can I never see you again? \\n How can I ever know why some stay and others go? \\n When I don’t, ooh \\n I don’t want you to go \\n I guess I know by now \\n That we will meet again somehow \\n  \\n Time can come and wash away the pain \\n But I just want my mind to stay the same \\n To hear your voice \\n To see your face \\n There’s not one moment I’d erase \\n You are a guest here now \\n  \\n So baby \\n How can I forget your love? \\n How can I never see you again? \\n  \\n Oh...Ummm... \\n It was a coldest day in December \\n A day I always will remember \\n I looked into your eyes \\n And faced my deepest fear \\n I had drifted too far \\n Far from you my dear \\n So how could I \\n Turn away from the one I love \\n How could I \\n When I know what my heart\\'s made of \\n Could it be \\n That your soul lives inside of me \\n How could I ever say good-bye \\n Why was I so afraid to tell her \\n That for her I would fight a thousand soldiers \\n But just like an angry child \\n I kept my feelings locked inside \\n There were rivers of tears \\n Flowing from her eyes \\n So how could I \\n Turn away from the one I love \\n How could I \\n When I know what my heart\\'s made of \\n Could it be \\n That your soul lives inside of me \\n How could I ever say good-bye \\n How could I ever say good-bye \\n  \\n When you fall in love \\n You never know how long it lasts \\n But the one thing I know in my heart \\n Is that I was fading much too fast \\n So how could I \\n Turn away from the one I love \\n How could I (could I) \\n When I know what my heart\\'s made of \\n Could it be \\n That your soul lives inside of me \\n How could I ever say good-bye \\n How could I ever say good-bye \\n How could I ever say good-bye \\n  \\n How to fight loneliness \\n  \\n Smile all the time \\n  \\n Shine your teeth to meaningless \\n  \\n And sharpen them with lies \\n  \\n And whatever is going down \\n  \\n Will you follow around \\n  \\n That\\'s how you fight loneliness \\n  \\n You laugh at every joke \\n  \\n Drag your blanket blindly \\n Fill your heart with smoke \\n  \\n And the first thing that you want \\n  \\n Will be the last thing you\\'ll ever need \\n  \\n That\\'s how you fight it \\n  \\n Just smile all the time \\n  \\n Just smile all the time \\n  \\n Just smile all the time \\n  \\n Just smile all the time \\n  \\n Do do do \\n  \\n Do do do \\n Do do do \\n Do do do \\n Do do do \\n Do do do \\n Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face \\n You told me how proud you were, but I walked away \\n If only I knew what I know today \\n Ooh, ooh \\n  \\n I would hold you in my arms \\n I would take the pain away \\n Thank you for all you\\'ve done \\n Forgive all your mistakes \\n There\\'s nothing I wouldn\\'t do \\n To hear your voice again \\n Sometimes I wanna call you \\n But I know you won\\'t be there \\n  \\n Ohh I\\'m sorry for blaming you \\n For everything I just couldn\\'t do \\n And I\\'ve hurt myself by hurting you \\n  \\n Some days I feel broke inside but I won\\'t admit \\n Sometimes I just wanna hide \\'cause it\\'s you I miss \\n And it\\'s so hard to say goodbye \\n When it comes to these rules \\n  \\n Would you tell me I was wrong? \\n Would you help understand? \\n Are you looking down upon me? \\n Are you proud of who I am? \\n  \\n There\\'s nothing I wouldn\\'t do \\n To have just one more chance \\n To look into your eyes \\n And see you looking back \\n  \\n Ohh I\\'m sorry for blaming you \\n For everything I just couldn\\'t do \\n And I\\'ve hurt myself, ohh \\n  \\n If I had just one more day \\n I would tell you how much that I\\'ve missed you \\n Since you\\'ve been away \\n Ooh, it\\'s dangerous \\n It\\'s so out of line \\n To try and turn back time \\n  \\n I\\'m sorry for blaming you \\n For everything I just couldn\\'t do \\n And I\\'ve hurt myself by hurting you \\n  \\n by bluemary \\n i hurt myself today \\n to see if i still feel \\n i focus on the pain \\n the only thing that\\'s real \\n the needle tears a hole \\n the old familiar sting \\n try to kill it all away \\n but i remember everything \\n what have i become? \\n my sweetest friend \\n everyone i know \\n goes away in the end \\n you could have it all \\n my empire of dirt \\n i will let you down \\n i will make you hurt \\n i wear my crown of shit \\n on my liar\\'s chair \\n full of broken thoughts \\n i cannot repair \\n beneath the stain of time \\n the feeling disappears \\n you are someone else \\n i am still right here \\n what have i become? \\n my sweetest friend \\n everyone i know \\n goes away in the end \\n you could have it all \\n my empire of dirt \\n i will let you down \\n i will make you hurt \\n if i could start again \\n a million miles away \\n i would keep myself \\n i would find a way \\n You said goodbye \\n I fell apart \\n  \\n I fell from all we had \\n To I never knew \\n I needed you so bad \\n You need to let things go \\n I know, you told me so \\n I\\'ve been through hell \\n To break the spell \\n Why did I ever let you slip away \\n Can\\'t stand another day without you \\n Without the feeling \\n I once knew \\n I cry silently \\n I cry inside of me \\n I cry hopelessly \\n Cause I know I\\'ll never breathe your love again \\n I cry \\n Cause you\\'re not here with me \\n Cause I\\'m lonely as can be \\n I cry hopelessly \\n Cause I know I\\'ll never breathe your love again \\n If you could see me now \\n You would know just how \\n How hard I try \\n Not to wonder why \\n I wish I could believe in something new \\n Oh please somebody tell me it\\'s not true (oh girl) \\n I\\'ll never be over you \\n Why did I ever let you slip away \\n Can\\'t stand another day without you \\n Without the feeling \\n I once knew \\n  \\n I cry silently \\n I cry inside of me \\n I cry hopelessly \\n Cause I know I\\'ll never breathe your love again \\n I cry \\n Cause you\\'re not here with me \\n Cause I\\'m lonely as can be \\n I cry hopelessly \\n Cause I know I\\'ll never breathe your love again \\n  \\n If I could have you back tomorrow \\n If I could lose the pain and sorrow \\n I would do just anything \\n To make you see \\n You still love me \\n  \\n Cause I know I\\'ll never breathe your love again \\n I cry silently \\n I cry inside of me \\n I cry hopelessly \\n Cause I know I\\'ll never breathe your love again \\n I cry \\n Cause you\\'re not here with me \\n I cry \\n Cause I\\'m lonely as can be \\n I cry hopelessly \\n Cause I know I\\'ll never breathe your breathe your love again \\n  \\n Maybe It s intuition \\n Some things you just don t question \\n in your eyes. \\n I see my future in an instant and there it goes \\n I think I ve found my best friend \\n I know that it might sound more than a little \\n carzy but I believe \\n I knew I loved you before I met you \\n I think I dreamed you into life \\n I knew I loved you before I met you \\n I have been waiting all my life \\n There s just no rhyme or reason \\n only a sense of completion \\n and in your eyes \\n I see the missing pieces \\n I m searching for I think I ve found my way home \\n I know that it might sound more than a little \\n Crazy but I believe \\n I knew I loved you before I met you \\n I think I dreamed you into life \\n I knew I loved you before I met you \\n I have been waiting all my life \\n  \\n I knew I loved you before I met you \\n I think I dreamed you into life \\n I knew I loved you before I met you \\n I have been waiting all my life \\n I knew I loved you before I met you \\n I think I dreamed you into life \\n I knew I loved you before I met you \\n I have been waiting all my life \\n  \\n I knew I loved you before I met you \\n  \\n I leave the gas on \\n Walk the allies in the dark \\n Sleep with candles burning \\n I leave the door unlocked \\n I\\'m weaving a rope and \\n Running all the red lights \\n Did I get your attention \\n Cause I\\'m sending \\n All the signs and \\n The clock is ticking \\n And I\\'ll be giving \\n My 2 weeks \\n  \\n Pick your favorite \\n Shade of black \\n You\\'d best \\n Prepare a speech \\n Say something funny \\n Say something sweet \\n But don\\'t say \\n That you loved me \\n  \\n Cause I\\'m still breathing \\n Though we\\'ve been \\n Ddead for awhile \\n This sickness has no cure \\n We\\'re goin down for sure \\n Already lost a grip \\n Best abandon ship \\n  \\n Maybe I was too pale \\n Maybe I was too fat \\n Maybe you wanted better \\n Better luck off in the sack \\n No formal education \\n And I swore way too much \\n But I swear \\n You didn\\'t fucking care \\n Cause we were in love \\n  \\n So as I write this letter \\n And she\\'d my last tear \\n No, it\\'s all for the better \\n That we end this this year \\n Let\\'s close this chapter \\n Say one last prayer \\n But don\\'t say \\n That you loved me \\n  \\n Cause I\\'m still breathing \\n Though we\\'ve been \\n Ddead for awhile \\n This sickness has no cure \\n We\\'re goin down for sure \\n Already lost a grip \\n Best abandon ship \\n Cause I\\'m still breathing \\n Though we\\'ve been \\n Ddead for awhile \\n This sickness has no cure \\n We\\'re goin down for sure \\n Already lost a grip \\n Best abandon ship \\n  \\n I\\'m still breathing \\n I\\'m still breathing \\n  \\n Once upon a time there was a girl \\n In her early years she had to learn \\n How to grow up living in a war that she called home \\n Never know just where to turn for shelter from the storm \\n Hurt me to see the pain across my mother\\'s face \\n Everytime my father\\'s fist would put her in her place \\n Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room \\n Hoping it would be over soon \\n  \\n Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same \\n And I still remember how you kept me so afraid \\n Strength is my mother for all the love she gave \\n Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday \\n And I\\'m OK \\n  \\n I often wonder why I carry all this guilt \\n When it\\'s you that helped me put up all these walls I\\'ve built \\n Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door \\n The echo of a broken child screaming \"please no more\" \\n Daddy, don\\'t you understand the damage you have done \\n To you it\\'s just a memory, but for me it still lives on \\n  \\n Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same \\n And I still remember how you kept me so, so afraid \\n Strength is my mother for all the love she gave \\n Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday \\n  \\n It\\'s not so easy to forget \\n All the lines you left along her neck \\n When I was thrown against cold stairs \\n And every day I\\'m afraid to come home \\n In fear of what I might see there \\n  \\n Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same \\n And I still remember how you kept me so afraid \\n Strength is my mother for all the love you gave \\n Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday \\n And I\\'m OK \\n  \\n I\\'m OK \\n  \\n Nobody knows who I really am, \\n I\\'ve never felt this empty before. \\n And if I ever need someone to come along, \\n Who\\'s gonna comfort me and keep me strong? \\n We are all rowing the boat of fate \\n The waves keep on coming and we can\\'t escape \\n But if we ever get lost on our way \\n The waves will guide you

\\n Even just for a day \\n I’d roll out of bed in the morning \\n And throw on what I wanted and go \\n Drink beer with the guys \\n And chase after girls \\n I’d kick it with who I wanted \\n And I’d never get confronted for it \\n Because they’d stick up for me \\n  \\n If I were a boy \\n I think that I’d understand \\n how it feels to love a girl \\n I swear I’d be a better man \\n I’d listen to her \\n cause I know how it hurts \\n when you loose the one you wanted \\n cause he’s taken you for granted \\n and everything you had got destroyed! \\n If I were a boy \\n  \\n I would turn off my phone \\n Tell everyone that its broken \\n so they think that I was sleeping alone \\n I’d put myself first \\n and make the rules as I go \\n cause I know that she’ll be faithful \\n waiting for me to come home ( to come home) \\n  \\n If I were a boy \\n I think that I could understand \\n how it feels to love a girl \\n I swear I’d be a better man \\n I’d listen to her \\n Cause I know how it hurts \\n when you loose the one you wanted \\n cause he’s taken you for granted \\n and everything you had got destroyed! \\n  \\n It’s a little too late for you to come back \\n Say its just a mistake \\n Think I forgive you like that \\n If you thought I would wait for you \\n You thought wrong \\n  \\n But your just a boy \\n You don’t understand (and you don’t understand) \\n How it feels to love a girl \\n Someday you’ll wish you were a better man \\n You don’t listen to her \\n You don’t care how it hurts \\n Until you lose the one you wanted \\n Cause you taken her for granted \\n And everything that you had got destroyed \\n But your just a boy… \\n  \\n Last night I heard my own heart beating \\n Sounded like footsteps on my stairs \\n Six months gone and I\\'m still reaching \\n Even though I know you\\'re not here \\n I was playing back a thousand memories baby \\n Thinking \\'bout everything we\\'ve been through \\n Maybe I\\'ve been going back too much lately \\n Time stood still and I had you \\n  \\n Come back come back come back to me like \\n You would you would if this was a movie \\n Stand in the rain outside \\'til I came out \\n  \\n Come back come back come back to me \\n Like you could you could if you just said you\\'re sorry \\n I know that we could work it out somehow \\n But if this was a movie you\\'d be here by now \\n  \\n I know people change and these things happen \\n But I remember how it was back then \\n Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing \\n Cos nothing like this ever happened to them \\n Now I\\'m pacing down the hall chasing down the street \\n Flashback to a night when you said to me \\n Nothings gonna change not for me and you \\n Not before I knew how much I had to lose... \\n  \\n Come back come back come back to me like \\n You would you would if this was a movie \\n Stand in the rain outside til I came out \\n  \\n Come back come back come back to me \\n Like you could you could if you just said you\\'re sorry \\n I know that we could work it out somehow \\n But if this was a movie you\\'d be here by now \\n  \\n If you you\\'re out there, if you\\'re somewhere, if you\\'re moving on \\n I\\'ve been waiting for you wary since you\\'ve been gone \\n I just want it back the way it was before \\n And I just want to see you back at my front door \\n And I say \\n Come back, come back, come back to me like \\n You would, before you said it\\'s not that easy \\n Before the fight, before I left you out \\n But I take it all back now \\n  \\n Come back, come back, come back to me like \\n You would, you would if this was a movie \\n Stand in the rain outside til I came out \\n  \\n Come back, come back, come back to me like \\n You could, you could if you just said you\\'re sorry \\n I know that we could work it out somehow \\n But if this was a movie, you\\'d be here right now \\n  \\n You\\'d be here right now \\n It\\'s not the kind of ending you want to see now \\n Figure out a better ending \\n Ohhh oh \\n I thought you\\'d be here right now \\n Whoa oh \\n  \\n in my secret life \\n in my secret life \\n in my secret life \\n in my secret life \\n I saw you this morning. \\n You were moving so fast. \\n Cant seem to loosen my grip \\n On the past. \\n And I miss you so much. \\n Theres no one in sight. \\n And were still making love \\n In My Secret Life \\n In My Secret Life \\n I smile when Im angry. \\n I cheat and I lie. \\n I do what I have to do \\n To get by. \\n  \\n But I know what is wrong. \\n And I know what is right. \\n And Id die for the truth \\n In My Secret Life. \\n In My Secret Life \\n Hold on, hold on, my brother. \\n My sister, hold on tight. \\n I finally got my orders. \\n Ill be marching through the morning, \\n Marching through the night, \\n Moving cross the borders \\n Of My Secret Life. \\n Looked through the paper. \\n Makes you want to cry. \\n Nobody cares if the people \\n Live or die. \\n  \\n And the dealer wants you thinking \\n That its either black or white. \\n Thank God its not that simple \\n In My Secret Life \\n I bite my lip. \\n I buy what I\\'m told: \\n From the latest hit, \\n To the wisdom of old. \\n But I\\'m always alone. \\n And my heart is like ice. \\n And it\\'s crowded and cold \\n In My Secret Life \\n In My Secret Life \\n In My Secret Life \\n In My Secret Life \\n In My Secret Life \\n In My Secret Life \\n In My Secret Life \\n In My Secret Life \\n  \\n Guess you really did it this time \\n Left yourself in your war path \\n Lost your balance on a tight rope \\n Lost your mind trying to get it back \\n  \\n Wasn\\'t it easier in your lunchbox days \\n Always a bigger bed to crawl into \\n Wasn\\'t it beautiful when you believed in everything \\n And everybody believed in you \\n  \\n It\\'s alright, just wait and see \\n Your string of lights is still bright to me \\n Oh, who your are is not where you\\'ve been \\n You\\'re still an innocent \\n  \\n Still an innocent \\n  \\n Did some things you can\\'t speak of \\n But tonight you live it all again \\n You wouldn\\'t be shattered on the floor now \\n If only you had seen what you know now then \\n  \\n Wasn\\'t it easier in your firefly catching days \\n When everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you \\n Wasn\\'t it beautiful running wild \\'til you fell asleep \\n Before the monsters caught up to you \\n  \\n It\\'s alright, just wait and see \\n Your string of lights is still bright to me \\n Oh, who you are is not where you\\'ve been \\n You\\'re still an innocent \\n It\\'s okay, life is a tough crowd \\n Thirty two and still growing up now \\n Who you are is not what you did \\n You\\'re still an innocent \\n  \\n Time turns flames to embers \\n You\\'ll have new Septembers \\n Every one of us has messed up too \\n Minds change like the weather \\n I hope you remember \\n Today is never too late to be brand new. \\n  \\n It\\'s alright just wait and see your \\n String of lights are still bright to me \\n Who you are is not where you\\'ve been \\n You\\'re still an innocent \\n It\\'s okay life is a tough crowd \\n 32 and still growing up now \\n Who you are is not what you did \\n You\\'re still an innocent \\n  \\n Lost your balance on a tight rope \\n It\\'s never too late to get it back \\n  \\n She can’t see the way your eyes \\n Light up when you smile \\n She’ll never notice how you stop and stare whenever she walks by \\n And you can’t see me wantin\\' you the way you want her \\n But you are everything to me \\n  \\n I just wanna show you \\n She don’t even know you \\n She\\'s never gonna love you like I want to \\n And you just see right through me \\n If you only knew me \\n We could be a beautiful \\n Miracle \\n Unbelievable \\n Instead of just invisible \\n  \\n There’s a fire inside of you \\n That can’t help but shine through \\n She’s never gonna see the light no matter what you do \\n And all I think about is how to make you think of me \\n And everything that we could be \\n  \\n I just wanna show you \\n She don’t even know you \\n Baby, let me love you \\n Let me want you \\n You just see right through me \\n But if you only knew me \\n We could be a beautiful \\n Miracle \\n Unbelievable \\n Instead of just invisible \\n  \\n Like shadows in a faded light \\n Oh, we’re invisible \\n I just wanna open your eyes \\n And make you realize \\n  \\n I just wanna show you \\n She don’t even know you \\n Baby, let me love you \\n Let me want you \\n You just see right through me \\n But if you only knew me \\n We could be a beautiful \\n Miracle \\n Unbelievable \\n Instead of just invisible \\n  \\n She can’t see the way your eyes light up when you smile \\n  \\n She said the sleepers on tracks have woken up \\n It\\'s the end of the line I guess our luck is up \\n It was fun while it lasted cause nothing ever does \\n Love has lost its meaning and it was wasted on us \\n In the electrical storm you were running wild \\n You had a death wish you were a child \\n I came to bearing a lightning bolt \\n If you came back as the deep sea, \\n I would come back as the salt \\n It\\'s like your head is stuck in a tightening vise \\n Your ears are deaf to your friends’ advice \\n Because you know that your heart will never be full \\n It doesn\\'t always have to be beautiful \\n Unless its beautiful \\n  \\n Okay leave now leave now if you just can\\'t stay \\n  Because there’s nothing worse than somebody pretending away \\n The years of their youth they will never get back \\n So I\\'ll go home and practice the traits you said I lacked \\n Like listening to the thunder of your heart \\n And how with every other beat we grew further apart \\n Love is always going to be hard to you both \\n Never thinking that you\\'ll ever love anyone else as much \\n But it’s ugly, it’s ugly now yeah I know \\n But you never give things enough time to grow \\n It\\'s like driving through a carnival \\n It doesn\\'t always have to be beautiful \\n Unless its beautiful \\n  \\n Baby I know it\\'s over \\n Tell me (please) wait ‘til you\\'re sober \\n Now we know it’s true \\n The waiting never quite felt like waiting when the waiting was with you \\n Baby I know it\\'s over \\n Tell me (please) wait ‘til you\\'re sober \\n Now we know it’s true \\n The waiting never quite felt like waiting when the waiting was with you \\n  \\n So let me tell you tell you a thing or two \\n About how to survive when there is a me and a you \\n It\\'s awful, it\\'s gruesome, it\\'s something, it\\'s cruel \\n Forever you will ask God if this happened to you \\n ‘Cause I\\'m always thinking, thinking about where you are \\n Who you\\'re with and if your mind is far \\n From what we do when we\\'re alone \\n Love is to much for me and now the wall needs to grow \\n  \\n So when your head stuck in a tightening vise \\n Your ears are deaf to your friends’ advice \\n Because you know that your heart will never be full \\n It doesn\\'t always have to be beautiful \\n Unless its beautiful \\n Baby I know it\\'s over \\n Tell me (please) wait ‘til you\\'re sober \\n Now we know it’s true \\n The waiting never quite felt like waiting when the waiting was with you \\n Baby I know it\\'s over \\n Tell me (please) wait ‘til you\\'re sober \\n Now we know it’s true \\n The waiting never quite felt like waiting when the waiting was with you \\n  - The End - \\n The story is different now, \\n the records are playing in the living room \\n And you might say you\\'re wounded, \\n and I might say I\\'m hurt \\n But we knew the difference then between \\n the fire and the earth \\n And we may say we\\'re broken, \\n we may say we\\'re weak, \\n But we knew before we started, \\n oh the secrets we would keep \\n  \\n And it\\'s all okay, \\n cause love will find a way to be what love is \\n And it\\'s all okay, \\n cause love will find a way to be what love is \\n  \\n I\\'ll move to the country, \\n and live inside the deepest, darkest wood \\n And I\\'ll write you a letter \\n and tell you all the things I should say to your face \\n And I won\\'t send it to you, \\n I\\'ll send it to your mother\\'s place \\n And she won\\'t give it to you, \\n that\\'s how brave I\\'ll grow here in my cave \\n  \\n And it\\'s all okay, \\n cause love will find a way to be what love is \\n And it\\'s all okay, \\n cause love will find a way to be what love is \\n  \\n And you\\'ll move to the city, marry a pretty girl \\n And she will make you smile all the while you\\'ll be looking for \\n what you left behind \\n And she will bring you children \\n and oh how you will love them with that heart of yours \\n I won\\'t visit you, I\\'ll know by then the kinder thing to do \\n  \\n Oh it\\'s all okay, \\n cause love will find a way to be what love is \\n And it\\'s all okay, \\n cause love will find a way to be what love is \\n And it\\'s all okay, \\n cause love will find a way to be what love is \\n And it\\'s all okay, \\n cause love will find a way to be what love is \\n  \\n The story is different now, \\n the records are playing in the living room \\n  \\n \\'Cause all that\\'s waiting is regret \\n And don\\'t you know I\\'m not your ghost anymore \\n You lost the love I loved the most \\n  \\n I learned to live half alive \\n And now you want me one more time \\n  \\n And who do you think you are? \\n Running around leaving scars \\n Collecting your jar of hearts \\n And tearing love apart \\n You\\'re gonna catch a cold \\n From the ice inside your soul \\n So don\\'t come back for me \\n Who do you think you are? \\n  \\n I hear you\\'re asking all around \\n If I am anywhere to be found \\n But I have grown too strong \\n To ever fall back in your arms \\n  \\n I\\'ve learned to live half alive \\n And now you want me one more time \\n  \\n And who do you think you are? \\n Running around leaving scars \\n Collecting your jar of hearts \\n And tearing love apart \\n You\\'re gonna catch a cold \\n From the ice inside your soul \\n So don\\'t come back for me \\n Who do you think you are? \\n  \\n And it took so long just to feel all right \\n Remember how to put back the light in my eyes \\n I wish I had missed \\n The first time that we kissed \\n \\'Cause you\\'ve broke all your promises \\n And now you\\'re back \\n But you don\\'t get to get me back \\n  \\n And who do you think you are? \\n Running around leaving scars \\n Collecting your jar of hearts \\n And tearing love apart \\n You\\'re gonna catch a cold \\n From the ice inside your soul \\n So don\\'t come back for me \\n Don\\'t come back at all \\n  \\n And who do you think you are? \\n Running around leaving scars \\n Collecting your jar of hearts \\n And tearing love apart \\n You\\'re gonna catch a cold \\n From the ice inside your soul \\n So don\\'t come back for me \\n Don\\'t come back at all \\n Who do you think you are? \\n  \\n Who do you think you are? \\n Who do you think you are? \\n  \\n The fire\\'s dying out \\n All the embers have been spent \\n Outside on the street \\n Lovers hide in the shadows \\n You look at me \\n I look at you \\n There\\'s only one thing \\n I want you to do \\n  \\n Kiss me \\n I want you to kiss me \\n Like a stranger once again \\n Kiss me like a stranger once again \\n I want to believe that our love\\'s a mystery \\n I want to believe that our love\\'s a sin \\n I want you to kiss me \\n Like a stranger once again \\n  \\n You wear the same kind of perfume \\n You wore when we met \\n I suppose there\\'s something comforting \\n In knowing what to expect \\n But when you brushed up against me \\n Before I knew your name \\n Everything was thrilling \\n Because nothing was the same \\n  \\n I want you to kiss me \\n I want you to kiss me \\n Like a stranger once again \\n Kiss me like a stranger once again \\n I want to believe our love\\'s a mystery \\n I want to believe our love\\'s a sin \\n Oh, will you kiss me like a stranger once again \\n I want you to kiss me like a stranger \\n  \\n Kiss me like a stranger \\n Once again \\n  \\n Lady? \\n Yes Bird? \\n It\\'s cold \\n I know \\n Bird...

\\n  \\n Away? \\n  \\n I do recall now the smell of the rain \\n Fresh on the pavement I ran off the plane \\n That July 9th the beat of your heart \\n It jumps through your shirt \\n I can still feel your arms \\n But now I\\'ll go sit on the floor \\n Wearing your clothes \\n All that I know is that \\n I don\\'t know how to be something you miss \\n  \\n Never thought we\\'d have a last kiss \\n Never imagined we\\'d end like this \\n Your name, forever the name on my lips \\n  \\n I do remember the swing in your step \\n The life of the party, you\\'re showing off again \\n And I roll my eyes and then you pull me in \\n I\\'m not much for dancing but for you I did \\n Because I love your handshake \\n Me and my father \\n I love how you walk with \\n your hands in your pockets \\n How you kissed me when I was \\n In the middle of saying something \\n There\\'s not a day when I don\\'t miss those rude interruptions \\n But now I\\'ll go sit on the floor \\n Wearing your clothes \\n All that I know is that \\n I don\\'t know how to be something you miss \\n  \\n Never thought we\\'d have a last kiss \\n Never imagined we\\'d end like this \\n Your name, forever the name on my lips \\n Mmmmm mmm mmm \\n  \\n So I\\'ll watch you live in pictures like I used to watch you sleep \\n And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe \\n And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are \\n Hope it\\'s nice where you are \\n  \\n And I hope the sun shines \\n And it\\'s a beautiful day \\n And something reminds you \\n You wish you had stayed \\n You can plan for a change in weather and town \\n But I never planned on you changing your mind \\n  \\n So.. I\\'ll go sit on the floor \\n Wearing your clothes \\n All that I know is that \\n I don\\'t know how to be something you miss \\n  \\n Never thought we\\'d have a last kiss \\n Never imagined we\\'d end like this \\n Your name, forever the name on my lips \\n  \\n Just like our last kiss \\n Forever the name on my lips \\n Forever the name on my lips \\n  \\n Just like our last \\n  \\n Let it go

here in the cold thin air \\n I finally can breathe \\n  \\n I know i left a life behind but I\\'m to relieved to grieve \\n . \\n Let it go \\n Let it go \\n  \\n Can\\'t hold you back anymore \\n

\\n Staring blankly ahead \\n Just making my way \\n Making a way \\n Through the crowd \\n  \\n And I need you \\n And I miss you \\n And now I wonder \\n If I could fall \\n Into the sky \\n Do you think time \\n Would pass me by \\n Cause you know I\\'d walk a thousand miles \\n If I could just see you... tonight \\n  \\n It\\'s always times like these \\n When I think of you \\n And I wonder if you ever think of me \\n  \\n Cause everything\\'s so wrong \\n And I don\\'t belong \\n Living in your precious memory \\n  \\n Cause I need you \\n And I miss you \\n And now I wonder \\n If I could fall \\n Into the sky \\n Do you think time \\n Would pass me by,oh \\n Cause you know I\\'d walk a thousand miles \\n If I could just see you... tonight \\n  \\n And I, I don\\'t wanna let you know \\n I, I drown in your memory \\n I,I don\\'t wanna let this go \\n I, I\\'ve fallen... \\n Making my way down town \\n Walking fast \\n Faces pass \\n And I\\'m home bound \\n  \\n Staring blankly ahead \\n Just making my way \\n Making a way \\n Through the crowd \\n  \\n And I still need you \\n And I still miss you \\n And now I wonder \\n If I could fall into the sky \\n Do you think time, would pass us by \\n Cause you kow I\\'d walk a thousand miles \\n If I could just see you... \\n If I could fall into the sky \\n Do you think time would pass me by \\n Cause you know I\\'d walk a thousand miles \\n If I could just see you... \\n If I could just hold you... \\n Tonight \\n  \\n I can only say these things to you while you\\'re sleeping \\n I hear the hum from the wires and the sounds of the morning creep in \\n I lie awake and pretend you can hear me \\n  \\n And you tell me that you\\'re scared that you\\'re turning into your mother \\n And I feel myself turn into my father \\n We could lie to each other like they do and say we\\'re so happy \\n It\\'s easy when you\\'re young and you still want it so badly \\n  \\n And I feel my heart pounding \\n And I think that I might scream \\n  \\n I can tell you that you\\'re all I ever wanted, dear \\n And I can utter every word you\\'ve ever hope to hear \\n But I shudder when I think that I might not be here forever, forever, forever \\n  \\n That night you whispered like a ghost and you looked so shaken \\n You were so quiet and small and you tell me you wanted to be taken \\n I just never think of you as the kind of girl who would say that \\n And you suddenly seem like some faceless thing in my grasp \\n Your eyes so wide, your face so low \\n It\\'s the face of someone I don\\'t know \\n I can tell you that you\\'re all I ever wanted, dear \\n And I can utter every word you\\'d ever hope to hear \\n Shudder when I think that I might not be here forever, forever, forever \\n  \\n And all I could think is that it must be a kind of rebellion \\n To arm our fears like soldiers and slay them. \\n I can tell you that you\\'re all I\\'ve ever wanted, dear \\n Through the dim while you\\'re breathing, while you\\'re sleeping in here \\n Waken and you ask me if I\\'m going to be here forever, forever, forever \\n Your face so twisted and your eyes are light \\n I want to tell I can save you when you cry at night \\n But I\\'d be lying \\n Love is defying \\n  \\n Don’t know what to do anymore \\n I’ve lost the only love worth fighting for \\n I’ll drown in my tears \\n Don’t they see? \\n That which show you that which make you hurt like me \\n All the same \\n I don’t want mudslinging games \\n It’s such a shame \\n To let you walk away \\n  \\n Is there a chance? \\n A fragment of light at the end of the tunnel? \\n A reason to fight? \\n Is there a chance you may change your mind? \\n Or are we ashes and wine? \\n Don’t know if our fate’s already sealed \\n This day’s spinning surface on a wheel \\n I’m ill with the thought of your kiss \\n Coffee laced intoxicating on her lips \\n  \\n Cut it out \\n I’ve got no claim on you now \\n Not allowed to wear your freedom down \\n  \\n Is there a chance? \\n A fragment of light at the end of the tunnel? \\n A reason to fight? \\n Is there a chance you may chance your mind? \\n Or are we ashes and wine? \\n  \\n I’ll tear myself away \\n That is what you need \\n There is nothing left to say \\n But \\n  \\n Is there a chance? \\n A fragment of light at the end of the tunnel? \\n A reason to fight? \\n Is there a chance you may change your mind? \\n Or are we ashes and wine? \\n The day’s still ashes and wine \\n Or are we ashes? \\n Listen dear \\n I need you to hear. \\n I cannot disappear \\n I\\'ve tried again and again and again. \\n  \\n I know we said \\n That we\\'d give up \\n You said we\\'d had enough \\n Again and again and again. \\n  \\n But you, you\\'re always on my mind. \\n It\\'s like this all the time. \\n Say it\\'s cause you\\'re mine \\n All mine... \\n  \\n And if you will, I will \\n Try to let it go. \\n And if you try, I\\'ll try \\n Try to let it show us the way \\n \\'Cause love is here to stay \\n Just look me in the eye \\n This is do or die \\n And I will stay in love \\n \\'Till you say enough \\n There is no giving in \\n There is no giving up in love. \\n  \\n Walk down the street \\n Stare at lots of things \\n The fast and steady streams \\n Again and again and again. \\n  \\n Do what I should \\n Try to stay busy \\n Your face is all I see \\n Again and again and again. \\n  \\n But you, you\\'re always on my mind. \\n It\\'s like this all the time. \\n Say it\\'s cause you\\'re mine \\n All mine... \\n  \\n And if you will, I will \\n Try to let it go. \\n And if you try, I\\'ll try \\n Try to let it show us the way \\n \\'Cause love is here to stay \\n Just look me in the eye \\n This is do or die \\n And I will stay in love \\n \\'Till you say enough \\n There is no giving in \\n There is no giving up in love. \\n  \\n Like a movie I once saw \\n In the darkness I recall \\n Feeling the beauty and the pain \\n And when you call my name \\n Say you feel the same. \\n  \\n Cause\\' if you will, I will \\n Try to let it go \\n And if you try, I\\'ll try \\n Try to let it show. \\n  \\n And if you will, I will \\n Try to let it go \\n And if you try, I\\'ll try \\n Try to let it show us the way \\n \\'Cause love is here to stay \\n Just look me in the eye \\n This is do or die \\n And I will stay in love \\n \\'Til you say enough \\n There is no giving in \\n There is no giving up in love \\n In love, in love \\n We\\'re in love \\n  \\n I cannot disappear... \\n I\\'ve tried again and again and again... \\n  \\n I\\'m lying alone with my head on the phone \\n Thinking of you till it hurts \\n I know you hurt too but what else can we do \\n Tormented and torn part \\n I wish I could carry your smile in my heart \\n For times when my life seems so low \\n It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring \\n When today doesn\\'t really know \\n Doesn\\'t really know \\n I\\'m all out of love \\n I\\'m so lost without you \\n I know you were right \\n Believing for so long \\n I\\'m all out of love \\n What am I without you \\n I can\\'t be too late \\n To say that I was so wrong \\n I want you to come back and carry me home \\n Away from these long lonely nights \\n I\\'m reaching for you \\n Are you feeling it too \\n Does the feeling seem oh so right \\n And what would you say \\n If I called on you now \\n And said that I can\\'t hold on \\n There\\'s no easy way it gets harder each day \\n Please love me or I\\'ll be gone \\n I\\'ll be gone \\n I\\'m all out of love \\n I\\'m so lost without you \\n I know you were right \\n Believing for so long \\n I\\'m all out of love \\n What am I without you \\n I can\\'t be too late \\n To say that I was so wrong \\n Ah what are you thinking of \\n What are you thinking of \\n What are you thinking of \\n What are you thinking o.................f \\n  \\n I\\'m all out of love \\n I\\'m so lost without you \\n I know you were right \\n Believing

\\n I\\'m so glad you made time to see me \\n How\\'s life? Tell me how\\'s your family \\n I haven\\'t seen them in a while \\n You\\'ve been good, busier than ever \\n Small talk, work and the weather \\n Your guard is up and I know why \\n Because the last time you saw me \\n is still burned in the back of your mind \\n You gave me roses and I left them there to die \\n So this is me swallowing my pride standing in \\n front of you saying I\\'m sorry for that night \\n And I go back to December all the time \\n It turns out freedom ain\\'t nothin but missin you \\n Wishin I\\'d realized what I had when you were mine \\n I go back to December turn around and make it all right \\n I go back to December all the time \\n  \\n These days I haven\\'t been sleepin \\n Stayin up playing back myself leavin \\n When your birthday passed and I didn\\'t call \\n Then I think about summer all the beautiful times \\n I watched you laughin from the passenger side \\n And realized I loved you in the fall \\n And then the cold came the dark days \\n when fear crept into my mind \\n You gave me all your lovin all I gave you was goodbye \\n  \\n So this is me swallowing my pride standing in \\n front of you saying I\\'m sorry for that night \\n And I go back to December all the time \\n It turns out freedom ain\\'t nothin but missin you \\n Wishin I\\'d realized what I had when you were mine \\n I go back to December turn around and change my own mind \\n I go back to December all the time \\n  \\n I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile \\n So good to me so right \\n And how you held me in your arms that September night \\n The first time you ever saw me cry \\n Maybe this is wishful thinkin \\n Probably mindless dreamin \\n If we loved again I swear I\\'d love you right \\n I\\'d go back in time and change it but I can\\'t \\n So if the chain is on your door I understand \\n  \\n This is me swallowing my pride standing in \\n front of you saying I\\'m sorry for that night \\n And I go back to December \\n It turns out freedom ain\\'t nothin but missin you \\n Wishin I\\'d realized what I had when you were mine \\n I go back to December turn around and make it all right \\n I go back to December turn around and change my own mind \\n I go back to December all the time \\n  \\n all the time \\n  \\n Your fingertips across my skin \\n The palm trees swaying in the wind \\n Images \\n  \\n You sang me Spanish lullabies \\n The sweetest sadness in your eyes \\n Clever trick \\n  \\n Well, I never want to see you unhappy \\n I thought you want the same for me \\n Goodbye, my almost lover \\n Goodbye, my hopeless dream \\n I\\'m trying not to think about you \\n Can\\'t you just let me be? \\n So long, my luckless romance \\n My back is turned on you \\n Should\\'ve known you\\'d bring me heartache \\n Almost lovers always do \\n  \\n We walked along a crowded street \\n You took my hand and danced with me \\n Images \\n And when you left, you kissed my lips \\n You told me you would never, never forget \\n These images \\n No \\n Well, I never want to see you unhappy \\n I thought you want the same for me \\n Goodbye, my almost lover \\n Goodbye, my hopeless dream \\n I\\'m trying not to think about you \\n Can\\'t you just let me be? \\n So long, my luckless romance \\n My back is turned on you \\n Should\\'ve known you bring me heartache \\n Almost lovers always do \\n  \\n I cannot go to the ocean \\n I cannot drive the streets at night \\n I cannot wake up in the morning \\n Without you on my mind \\n So you\\'re gone and I\\'m haunted \\n And I bet you are just fine \\n Did I make it that \\n Easy to walk right in and out \\n Of my life? \\n Goodbye, my almost lover \\n Goodbye, my hopeless dream \\n I\\'m trying not to think about you \\n Can\\'t you just let me be? \\n So long, my luckless romance \\n My back is turned on you \\n Should have known you bring me heartache \\n Almost lovers always do \\n  \\n I walked through the door with you \\n It was cold, but something \\'bout it felt like home somehow and I \\n Left my scarf there at your sister\\'s house \\n And you still got it in your drawer even now \\n  \\n Oh your sweet disposition \\n At my wide eye gaze \\n We\\'re singing in a car getting lost upstate \\n Autumn leaves falling down like pieces in the place \\n And I can picture it after all these days \\n And I know it\\'s long gone, and magics not here no more \\n And I might be okay, but i\\'m not, found it all \\n  \\n Cause here we are again on that little time street \\n You almost ring the red cause you were looking over me \\n Wind in my air I was there I remember it all too well \\n  \\n Photo album on my counter \\n Your cheeks were turning red \\n You used to be a little kid with your glasses in a twin size bed \\n And your mother\\'s telling stories \\'bout you on a tivo team \\n You tell me about your past thinking your future was me \\n  \\n And I know it\\'s long gone, and there was nothing else I could do \\n And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed you \\n  \\n Cause here we are again in the middle of the night \\n We\\'re dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light \\n Down the stairs I was there I remember it all too well \\n  \\n And maybe we got lost in translation \\n Maybe I asked for too much \\n But maybe this thing wasn\\'t masterpiece \\n He tored it all up \\n Running scared, I was there I remember it all too well \\n  \\n Hey you called me up again just to break me like a promise \\n So casually cruel in the name of being honest \\n I\\'mma crumble up piece of paper lying here \\n Cause I remember it all, all, all too well \\n  \\n Time won\\'t fly it\\'s like I\\'m paralyzed by it \\n I like to be my old self again \\n But i\\'m still trying to find it \\n After platshirt days and that\\'s when you made me your own \\n Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone \\n But your keep my old scarf from that very first week \\n Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me \\n You can\\'t get rid of it, cause you remember it all too well \\n  \\n Cause there we are again and I loved you so \\n Back before you lost the one real thing you\\'ve ever known \\n It was where, I was there, I remember it all too well \\n  \\n Wind in my air, you were there, you remember it all \\n Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all \\n It was where, I was there I remember it all too well \\n  \\n i hear the ticking of the clock \\n I\\'m lying here the room\\'s pitch dark \\n I wonder where you are tonight \\n No answer on the telephone \\n And the night goes by so very slow \\n Oh i hope that it won\\'t end though \\n Alone \\n  \\n Till now i always got by on my own \\n I never really cared until i met you \\n And now it chills me to the bone \\n How do i get you alone \\n How do i get you alone \\n  \\n You don\\'t know how long i have wanted \\n To touch your lips and hold you tight \\n You don\\'t know how long i have waited \\n And i was going to tell you tonight \\n But the secret is still my own \\n And my love for you is still unknown \\n Alone \\n  \\n Till now i always got by on my own \\n I never really cared until i met you \\n And now it chills me to the bone \\n How do i get you alone \\n How do i get you alone \\n How do i get you alone \\n How do i get you alone \\n Alone, alone \\n Across the ocean across the sea \\n Startin\\' to forget the way you look at me now \\n Over the mountains across the sky \\n Need to see your face need to looking your eyes \\n Through the strom and through the coulds \\n upside down now \\n I konw it\\'s hard babe to sleep at night \\n Don\\'t you worry \\n Cause everything\\'s gonna be alright I \\n Be alright I \\n Through the sorrow \\n And the fights

freezing \\n The world is sleeping \\n I am numb \\n Up the stairs to her apartment \\n She is balled up on the couch \\n Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte \\n Theyre not home to find us out \\n And we drive \\n Now that I have found someone \\n Im feeling more alone \\n Than I ever have before \\n Shes a brick and Im drowning slowly \\n Off the coast and Im headed nowhere \\n Shes a brick and Im drowning slowly \\n They call her name at 7:30 \\n I pace around the parking lot \\n Then I walk down to buy her flowers \\n And sell some gifts that I got \\n Cant you see \\n Its not me youre dying for \\n Now shes feeling more alone \\n Then she ever has before \\n Shes a brick and Im drowning slowly \\n Off the coast and Im headed nowhere \\n Shes a brick and Im drowning slowly \\n As weeks went by \\n It showed that she was not fine \\n They told me \"Son its time \\n To tell the truth\" \\n She broke down \\n And I broke down \\n Cause I was tired of lying \\n Driving home to her apartment \\n For the moment were alone \\n Shes alone \\n Im alone \\n Now I know it ... \\n Shes a brick and Im drowning slowly \\n Off the coast and Im headed nowhere \\n  \\n Car is parked, bags are packed, but what kind of heart doesn\\'t look back \\n At the comfortable glow from the porch, the one I will still call yours? \\n All those words came undone and now I\\'m not the only one \\n Facing the ghosts that decide if the fire inside still burns \\n  \\n All I have, all I need, he\\'s the air I would kill to breathe \\n Holds my love in his hands, still I\\'m searching for something \\n Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I\\'ll breathe again \\n I\\'ll breathe again \\n  \\n Open up next to you and my secrets become your truth \\n And the distance between that was sheltering me comes in full view \\n Hang my head, break my heart built from all I have torn apart \\n And my burden to bear is a love I can\\'t carry anymore \\n  \\n All I have, all I need, he\\'s the air I would kill to breathe \\n Holds my love in his hands, still I\\'m searching for something \\n Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I\\'ll breathe again \\n  \\n It hurts to be here \\n I only wanted love from you \\n It hurts to be here \\n What am I gonna do? \\n  \\n All I have, all I need, he\\'s the air I would kill to breathe \\n Holds my love in his hands, still I\\'m searching \\n All I have, all I need, he\\'s the air I would kill to breathe \\n Holds my love in his hands, still I\\'m searching for something \\n Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I\\'ll breathe again \\n I\\'ll breathe again \\n  \\n I wait here for you \\'fore I\\'m broken down \\n I\\'m coming down \\n This time \\n \\'fore my heart bleeds \\n Far and away, where they took you down \\n I lead them over to your house \\n  \\n Where I\\'m broken \\n  \\n Down by the people if they let you breath \\n Don\\'t give a damn if you still can\\'t see, \\n  \\n Still my heart beats for you. \\n  \\n Have become \\n All I love and all I hoped for. \\n  \\n But I must carry on \\n Always one \\n Never broken. \\n Run to the lobby where I saw you try \\n Don\\'t give a damn for your reasons why \\n Down in the valley where the church bells cry, \\n I\\'ll lead them over to your eyes \\n Whoa \\n  \\n I am one \\n  \\n I am one \\n  \\n Break story of \\n peace and love \\n In a future \\n Pride, sacrifice \\n Came around \\n Never broken \\n Down by the people if they let you breath, \\n Don\\'t give a damn if you still cant see. \\n Traveling down a street that I did not go \\n Down in the valley where the church bells cry, \\n I\\'ll lead them over to your eyes! \\n  \\n Whoa \\n  \\n I am one. \\n  \\n Whoa \\n  \\n I am one \\n  \\n I am one. \\n All the leaves are brown \\n And the sky is grey \\n I\\'ve been for a walk \\n On a winter\\'s day \\n I\\'d be safe and warm \\n If I was in L.A. \\n California dreaming \\n On such a winter\\'s day \\n  \\n Stopped into a church \\n I passed along the way \\n Well, I got down on my knees \\n And I pretend to pray \\n You know the preacher likes the cold \\n Preacher likes the cold \\n He knows I\\'m gonna stay \\n Knows I\\'m gonna stay \\n California dreaming \\n California dreaming \\n On such a winter\\'s day \\n  \\n All the leaves are brown \\n All the leaves are brown \\n And the sky is grey \\n And the sky is grey \\n I\\'ve been for a walk \\n I\\'ve been for a walk \\n On a winter\\'s day \\n On a winter\\'s day \\n If I didn\\'t tell her \\n I could leave today \\n I could leave today \\n California dreaming \\n On such a winter\\'s day \\n On such a winter\\'s day \\n On such a winter\\'s day \\n  \\n If you could get me a drink of water \\n Cause my lips are chapped and faded \\n Call my Aunt Marie \\n Help her gather all my things \\n And bury me in all my favorite colors \\n My sisters and my brothers still \\n I will not kiss you \\n Cause the hardest part of this \\n is leaving you \\n Now turn away \\n Cause I\\'m awful just to see \\n Cause all my hairs abandoned all my body \\n Oh my agony \\n Know that I will never marry \\n Baby\\' I\\'m just soggy from the chemo \\n But counting down the days to go \\n It just ain\\'t living \\n And I just hope you know \\n That if you say goodbye today \\n I\\'d ask you to be true \\n Cause the hardest part of this \\n is leaving you \\n Cause the hardest part of this \\n is leaving you \\n have you ever been swindled \\n by a swindler who lies \\n \\'cause he wants to see you smile, \\n have a good time, be inspired \\n and he doesn\\'t want for you to cry \\n or know he cries inside \\n so he hides behind his great triumphant rock \\n and roll disguise \\n we want things to be real \\n but you really can\\'t deny \\n we feel excited and on fire \\n is it wrong to lie and say he\\'s fine \\n when the reason he\\'s not fine is the \\n pressure of the power changing lives \\n and just for an hour all these people \\n will be better people \\n  \\n take this job and shove it, \\n adios I\\'m a ghost \\n I am leaving for the coast and \\n I\\'ll never work for anyone again \\n I am not your savior or your heavenly host \\n I\\'m just a piece of zwieback toast \\n getting soggy in a baby\\'s achin\\' mouth \\n I\\'m going south like the geese \\n I just goosed you and \\n so maybe I seem loose to you \\n but I don\\'t even want to screw \\n and I did once \\n but I don\\'t now \\n now that I see how you do things \\n the way you play and sing\\'s amazing \\n but the way you play the game is crazy \\n you don\\'t have to say you\\'re sorry \\n you don\\'t owe me anything \\n don\\'t owe me anything \\n  \\n sometimes it seems like \\n I\\'ve got all the answers \\n but the answers aren\\'t the same \\n when the questions keep on changing \\n like how will I react \\n when I see my mother crying \\n every single day \\'cause she is afraid of dying? \\n and how will I contain my anger \\n when Delila plays Unchained \\n Melody instead of Lost In Your Eyes? \\n and where will I go \\n where I can feel safe \\n when my family sells its place \\n and we all split up and move away? \\n I\\'m trying to be brave \\'cause \\n when I\\'m brave other people feel brave \\n but I feel like my heart is caving in \\n I\\'m trying to be brave \\'cause \\n when I\\'m braveother people feel brave \\n but I feel like my heart is caving in \\n I\\'m trying to be brave \\'cause \\n when I\\'m braveother people feel brave \\n but I feel like my heart is caving in \\n Every time we say goodbye \\n There is something breaking deep inside \\n But like a river always knows just where to flow \\n Now that disevery comes a feel like coming home \\n It\\'s Christmas in my heart when I\\'m with you (Hey...) \\n No matter where we are (Yeah...) \\n or what (or what...) we do (Ooo...) \\n Tomorrow may be great (Tomorrow may be great) \\n We may be torn apart \\n But if you stay tonight \\n It\\'s Christmas

people I\\'ve found. \\n  \\n Some of them got closer than others \\n Some wouldn\\'t even bother \\n and then you came around \\n  \\n I didn\\'t really know what to call you, \\n you didn\\'t know me at all \\n But I was happy to explain. \\n  \\n I never really knew how to move you \\n So I tried to intrude through \\n the little holes in your vanes \\n And I saw you \\n But that\\'s not an invitation \\n That\\'s all I get \\n If this is communication \\n I disconnect \\n I\\'ve seen you, I know you \\n But I don\\'t know \\n How to connect, so I disconnect \\n  \\n You always seem to know where to find me \\n and I\\'m still here behind you \\n In the corner of your eye. \\n  \\n I\\'ll never really learn how to love you \\n But I know that I love you \\n through the hole in the sky. \\n Where I see you \\n And that\\'s not an invitation \\n That\\'s all I get \\n If this is communication \\n I disconnect \\n I\\'ve seen you, I know you \\n But I don\\'t know \\n How to connect, so I disconnect \\n  \\n Well this is an invitation \\n It\\'s not a thread \\n If you want communication \\n That\\'s what you get \\n I\\'m talking and talking \\n But I don\\'t know \\n How to connect \\n And I hold a record for being patient \\n With your kind of hesitation \\n  \\n I need you, you want me \\n But I don\\'t know \\n How to connect, so I disconnect \\n I disconnect \\n  \\n I have seen peace. I have seen pain, \\n Resting on the shoulders of your name. \\n Do you see the truth through all their lies? \\n Do you see the world through troubled eyes? \\n And if you want to talk about it anymore, \\n Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder, \\n I\\'m a friend. \\n  \\n I have seen birth. I have seen death. \\n Lived to see a lover\\'s final breath. \\n Do you see my guilt? Should I feel fright? \\n Is the fire of hesitation burning bright? \\n And if you want to talk about it once again, \\n On you I depend. I\\'ll cry on your shoulder. \\n You\\'re a friend. \\n  \\n You and I have been through many things. \\n I\\'ll hold on to your heart. \\n I wouldn\\'t cry for anything, \\n But don\\'t go tearing your life apart. \\n  \\n I have seen fear. I have seen faith. \\n Seen the look of anger on your face. \\n And if you want to talk about what will be, \\n Come and sit with me, and cry on my shoulder, \\n I\\'m a friend. \\n And if you want to talk about it anymore, \\n Lie here on the floor \\n and cry on my shoulder once again, \\n cry on my shoulder, \\n I\\'m a friend. \\n  \\n From rape to right in, to real to live \\n should I lie down or stand up \\n And walk around again? \\n My eyes finally wide open up \\n My eyes finally wide open shut \\n to find the found of sound \\n That hears the touch of my tears. \\n Smells the taste of all we waste \\n Could feed the others \\n But we smother each other \\n With the nectar and pucker the sour \\n Of sugar sweet weather \\n blows through our trees \\n Swims through our seas

death to birth \\n oh, it\\'s a long lonely journey from death to...birth \\n Should I die again? \\n Should I die around the pounds of matter wailing to space? \\n I know I\\'ll never know until I come face to face \\n With my own cold, dead face \\n with my own wooden case \\n You are with me, with me, ooh, ohh, hmm \\n I\\'m mourning you ooh, ooh, ohh, hmm \\n  \\n It\\'s a long lonely
