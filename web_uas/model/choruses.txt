Another day wasted out of time 
 I cant get out of this 
 Altered state of mind 
 Im going overboard 
 My conscience meets decline 
 Into reality 
 I know this cant be fine 
 Cause Im all messed up 
 Making prefect nonsense 
 Drowning in my doubt too well 
 Cause Im all messed up 
 Going nowhere fast but circles in my mind 
 So blind 
 Who are these voices in my head 
 I cant go on like this 
 Living like the dead 
 I havent slept so long 
 Feeling sad I dread 
 Im talking to myself 
 Forgot what I just said 
 Cause Im all messed up 
 Making prefect nonsense 
 Drowning in my doubt too well 
 Cause Im all messed up 
 Going nowhere fast but circles in my mind 
 So blind 
 Well I hold my only enemy as closely as a friend 
 And I sold my own reality to further my descent 
 Self-destruction taking over its so easy to pretend 
 Introduction to this nightmare may never end 
 Can anyone help me drag my heels 
 Im running overtime 
 I cant hold down my meals 
 My mind is racing by 
 Staring blankly feels 
 Like pulling out my teeth 
 While this engine winds 
 Cause Im all messed up 
 Making prefect nonsense 
 Drowning in my doubt too well 
 Cause Im all messed up 
 Going nowhere fast but circles in my mind 
 So blind 
 Decaying ever faster 
 Under wear all the imminent disaster 
 Open up your eyes 
 As you ruminate the hopeless ends of time 
 Did you wander out your days lost and resigned? 
 Or recreate the universes in your mind? 
 Everybody is a bastard 
 The world is, like plaster 
 Crumblin apart from pressure of the blaster, waiting for a sign00:4832And the momentary pleasures take their turn, 
 As the wistful boy runs out of things to learn 
 The episodes of your are never to return 
 Scare up some hope, 
 Youre gonna need it just to cope, 
 You are the decision, numbers dont rely 
 When you bite the dust, 
 Wasnt the purpose all for trust, 
 Youll never relive it, 
 Think before you die 
 Yeah, think, think before you die 
  
 Deficit and depravation, 
 In the wake of desperation 
 We write the morals rectify the nation, 
 Now may be a time 
 As you ruminate the hopeless ends of time, 
 Do you wonder how your life has been defined? 
 You know eternity cant ever change your mind 
 You know eternity cant ever change your mind 
 So, think, think before you die 
 Whoa, think, think before you die 
  
 Finally I felt the calming breeze 
 Stepping out to watch the final scene 
 After all its you, my pride, and me 
 I can speak whatever I can speak 
 You see 
  
 Now I found the way to meet the means 
 Faker face to make the kingdom clean 
 After all its me, the king, and the beast 
 Whatever whatever I cant speak 
 A thing 
  
 How can I explain my winded feet? 
 Cut them off in 2nd Mark it seems 
 Cut me off before I start to see 
 But I can cry as long as my deceit 
 You see? 
 Me 
 See 
 Me 
 Me Me Me 
  
 Sound Im a dead neck, what a habit, 
 so Ill dig it up and bury it in 
 Ground What broke head, I think Im dyin, 
 I need another one to incubate the 
 Sound What broke head, what a habit, 
 I need another and another one 
 The Ground What a dead head, I think Im dyin, 
 I think Im dyin for another one 
 The Sound What a broke neck, what a lion, 
 I need another and another one 
 The Sound What a cheap trick, 
 what a habit, what a habit when I need it yeah 
 The Sound What a dead neck, what a lion, 
 I need another and another one 
 The Sound What a cheap trick, 
 what a habit, I think Im dyin for 
 The Sound What a dead neck, 
 what a habit, I think Ill dig up and bury it in 
 Ground What a broke head, 
 I think Im dyin, I think dyin 
  
 Peaceful confrontation meet war machine 
  
 Seizing all civil liberties 
  
 Honest ballotation among banshee 
  
 Spilling blood throughout humanity 
  
 You cannot hide the face of death 
 Oppression ruled by bloodshed 
  
 No disguise can deface evil 
 The massacre of innocent people 
  
 Deviated lies fear blinding in your eyes 
  
 Enforcing their truth through a gun 
  
 Aggressive discipline and barbaric control 
  
 Thousands of people cannot be wrong 
  
 You cannot hide the face of death 
 Oppression rules by bloodshed 
  
 No disguise can hide the evil 
 That stains the primitive sickle 
 Blood red 
  
 Growing opposition with words as ammunition 
  
 Expressions of lifes liberties 
  
 Aggressive discipline and barbaric control 
  
 Spilling blood throughout humanity 
 I want you to know, that Im happy for you 
 I wish nothing but the best for you both 
 An older version of me 
 Is she perverted like me 
 Would she go down on you in a theatre 
 Does she speak eloquently 
 And would she have your baby 
 Im sure shed make a really excellent mother 
  
 Cause the love that you gave that we made wasnt able 
 To make it enough for you to be open wide, no 
 And every time you speak her name 
 Does she know how you told me youd hold me 
 Until you died, til you died 
 But youre still alive 
  
 And Im here to remind you 
 Of the mess you left when you went away 
 Its not fair to deny me 
 Of the cross I bear that you gave to me 
 You, you, you oughta know 
  
 You seem very well, things look peaceful 
 Im not quite as well, I thought you should know 
 Did you forget about me Mr Duplicity 
 I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner 
 It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced 
 Are you thinking of me when you fuck her 
  
 Cause the love that you gave that we made wasnt able 
 To make it enough for you to be open wide, no 
 And every time you speak her name 
 Does she know how you told me youd hold me 
 Until you died, til you died 
 But youre still alive 
  
 And Im here to remind you 
 Of the mess you left when you went away 
 Its not fair to deny me 
 Of the cross I bear that you gave to me 
 You, you, you oughta know 
  
 Cause the joke that you laid on the bed that was me 
 And Im not gonna fade 
 As soon as you close your eyes and you know it 
 And every time I scratch my nails 
 down someone elses back 
 I hope you feel itwell can you feel it 
  
 And Im here to remind you 
 Of the mess you left when you went away 
 Its not fair to deny me 
 Of the cross I bear that you gave to me 
 You, you, you oughta know 
 And Im here to remind you 
 Of the mess you left when you went away 
 Its not fair to deny me 
 Of the cross I bear that you gave to me 
 You, you, you oughta know

 Round and round like good little roses 
  
 Blood roses, blood roses 
 Back on the street now 
  
 Blood roses, blood roses 
 Back on the street now, now, now

 From the throat of the loon

 Shaking your head like its all wrong 
 Before youre here youre already gone 
 And even with the light all around you 
 Youre all alone in the dark 
 Youre breaking your own heart 
 Taking it too far down the lonely road 
 You say its just one love 
 But when its close enough you just let it go 
 The very thing youve been the most afraid of 
 Youve been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart 
  
 Too many tears, too many falls 
 Its easy to hear behind these walls 
 But you dont have to walk in the shadows 
 Life is so hard 
 Youre breaking your own heart 
 Taking it too far down the lonely road 
 You say its just one love 
 But when its close enough you just let it go 
 The very thing youve been the most afraid of 
 Youve been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart 
  
 Youre breaking your own heart 
 Its not too late, Im still right here 
 If only you let go of your fears 
 Youre breaking your heart 
 Taking your own heart down the lonely road 
 You say its just one love 
 But when its close enough you just let it go 
 The very thing youve been the most afraid of 
 Youve been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart 
  
 Youre breaking your own heart 
  
 From the black of decieving lies 
 A new star is born now he brings you to light 
 With his hands untied 
  
 They tried so hard to follow, but no-one cared 
 Inside youre all so hollow, you understand 
  
 Hey, nothing you can say say, 
 nothing gonna change what youve done to me 
 Now its time to shine shine, 
 Im gonna take whats mine 
 While youre burning inside my light 
  
 I gave and you take 
 And I waited for you but I made a mistake 
 Its clear that youre fear is so near me 
 Because I see the look on youre face 
  
 You tried to hold me under, I held my breath 
 Alone and now you wonder, What I posess 
  
 Hey, nothing you can say say, 
 nothings gonna change what youve done to me 
 Now its time to shine shine, 
 youre gonna burn in my light 
 Hey, nothing you can say,

 Now its time to shine,

 Youre gonna burn in my light

 I see it in your eyes 
 Your feeling paranoid 
 You know just what Ive done 
 You know what Ive become 
 I feel it deep inside 
 With all the pain and lies 
 I know just what I want 
 I am an animal 
  
 I think its time I let you go 
 Why did you send me off ? 
  
 You cant cage the beast ! 
 Theres no break in me 
 You cant cage the beast inside of me 
 I feel the rage 
 And all the the pain 
 You cant cage the beast inside of me 
 Inside of me 
  
 I feel it in your vine 
 You are a parasite 
 Who knows just what Ive done 
 I think your time has come 
 You tried to turn the tide 
 I think youve lost your mind 
 Afraid of what I want 
 This sick animal Ive become 
  
 I think its time I let you go 
 Why did you send me off ? 
  
 You cant cage the beast ! 
 Theres no break in me 
 You cant cage the beast inside of me 
 I feel the rage 
 And all the pain 
 You cant cage the beast inside of me 
 Inside of ME !

 "What weve got here is failure to communicate 
 Some men you just cant reach 
 So, you get what we had here last week, 
 which is the way he wants it! 
 Well, he gets it! 
 N I dont like it any more than you men"  
 Look at your young men fighting 
 Look at your women crying 
 Look at your young men dying 
 The way theyve always done before 
 Look at the hate were breeding 
 Look at the fear were feeding 
 Look at the lives were leading 
 The way weve always done before 
 My hands are tied 
 The billions shift from side to side 
 And the wars go on with brainwashed pride 
 For the love of God and our human rights 
 And all these things are swept aside 
 By bloody hands time cant deny 
 And are washed away by your genocide 
 And history hides the lies of our civil wars 
 Dyou wear a black armband 
 When they shot the man 
 Who said "Peace could last forever" 
 And in my first memories 
 They shot Kennedy 
 I went numb when I learned to see 
 So I never fell for Vietnam 
 We got the wall of DC to remind us all 
 That you cant trust freedom 
 When its not in your hands 
 When everybodys fightin 
 For their promised land 
 And 
 I dont need your civil war 
 It feeds the rich while it buries the poor 
 Your power hungry sellin soldiers 
 In a human grocery store 
 Aint that fresh 
 I dont need your civil war 
 Look at the shoes your filling 
 Look at the blood were spilling 
 Look at the world were killing 
 The way weve always done before 
 Look in the doubt weve wallowed 
 Look at the leaders weve followed 
 Look at the lies weve swallowed 
 And I dont want to hear no more 
 My hands are tied 
 For all Ive seen has changed my mind 
 But still the wars go on as the years go by 
 With no love of God or human rights 
 Cause all these dreams are swept aside 
 By bloody hands of the hypnotized 
 Who carry the cross of homicide 
 And history bears the scars of our civil wars 
 "We practice selective annihilation of mayors 
 And government officials 
 For example to create a vacuum 
 Then we fill that vacuum 
 As popular war advances 
  
 I dont need your civil war 
 It feeds the rich while it buries the poor 
 Your power hungry sellin soldiers 
 In a human grocery store 
 Aint that fresh 
 And I dont need your civil war 
 I dont need your civil war 
 I dont need your civil war 
 Your power hungry sellin soldiers 
 In a human grocery store 
 Aint that fresh 
 I dont need your civil war 
 I dont need one more war 
 I dont need one more war 
 Whaz so civil bout war anyway 
 Crawl from the wreckage one more time 
 Horrific memory twists the mind 
 Dark, rugged, cold and hard to turn 
 Path of destruction, feel it burn 
 Still life 
 Incarnation 
 Still life 
 Infamy 
  
 Hallucination 
 Heresy 
 Still you run, whats to come? 
 Whats today?

 Feel us shift, every move we trace 
 Hunt you down without mercy 
 Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah 
 Luck Runs 
  
 I crawl back in 
 But your luck runs out 
  
 Luck Runs Out 
  
 The light that is not light is here 
 To flush you out with your own fear 
 You hide, you hide, but will be found 
 Release your crypt without a sound 
  
 Still life 
 Immolation 
 Still life 
 Infamy 
  
 Hallucination 
 Heresy 
 Still you run, whats to come? 
 Whats today?

 Hunt you down without mercy 
 Hunt you down all nightmare long 
 Luck Runs 
  
 I crawl back in 
 But your luck runs out 
  
 Then you crawl back in 
 Into your obsession 
 Never to return 
 This is your confession 
  
 Hunt you down without mercy 
 Hunt you down all nightmare long 
 Feel us breathe upon your face 
 Feel us shift, every move we trace 
 Hunt you down without mercy 
 Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah

 Have you ever been hated 
 or discriminated against? 
 I have, Ive been protested and demonstrated against 
 Picket signs for my wicked rhymes 
 Look at the times Sick is the mind 
 of the motha fuckin kid thats behind 
 all this commotion Emotions run deep 
 as oceans explodin 
 Tempers flaring from parents,

 Not takin nothin from no one,

 Keep kickin ass in the mornin,

 Leavem with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth

 So before they thrown 
 me inside my coffin and close it, 
 Ima expose it Ill take you back to 
 73 before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin CD 
 I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months 
 My faggot father must have 
 had his panties up in a bunch, 
 cuz he split 
 I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye 
 No, I dont on second thought, 
 I just fuckin wished he would die 
 I look at Hailie 
 and I couldnt picture leavin her side 
 Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and Id try 
 to make it work with her at least for Hailies sake 
 I maybe made some mistakes 
 but Im only human 
 But Im man enough to face them today 
 /What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb 
 but the smartest shit 
 I did was take them bullets out of that gun 
 Cuz ida killed em, 
  shit I would have shot Kim an him both 
 Its my life, Id like to welcome yall to The Eminem Show 
 Im sorry, Mama 
 I never meant to hurt you 
 I never meant to make you cry, but tonight

 one more time 
 Im sorry, Mama 
 I never meant to hurt you 
 I never meant to make you cry, but tonight 
 Im cleanin out my closet 
  
 Now I would never dis my own mama just to get recognition 
 Take a second to listen for you think this record is dissin, 
  But put yourself in my position 
  ust try to envision witnessin your 
 Mama poppin prescription pills in the kitchen, 
 bitchin that someones always g 
 oin throuh her purse and shits missin Going through 
  public housing systems, victim of Munchausens syndrome 
 My whole life I was made to believe 
 I was sick when I wasnt til I grew up, 
  now I blew up It makes you sick to ya stomach, 
 doesnt it? 
 Wasnt it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma? 
 So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma? 
 But guess what, 
 yer gettin older now and its cold when your lonely 
 An Nathans getting up so quick, 
 hes gonna know that your phoney 
 And Hailies getting so big now, 
 you should see her, shes beautiful 
 But youll never see her, 
 she wont even be at your funeral 
 See what hurts me the most is you wont 
 admit you was wrong Bitch, do ya song 
 Keep tellin yourself that you was a mom 
 But how dare you 
 try to take what you didnt help me to get 
 You selfish bitch, 
 I hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit 
  Remember when 
 Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? 
 Well, guess what, I am dead 
  Dead to you as can be 
 Im sorry, Mama 
 I never meant to hurt you 
 I never meant to make you cry, but tonight 
 Im cleanin out my closet 
  
 one more time 
 Im sorry, Mama 
 I never meant to hurt you 
 I never meant to make you cry, but tonight 
 Im cleanin out my closet 
  
 Told you I felt lucky with my humble breasts 
 Well I dont 
 Said that I was sure the world was gonna change 
 Well Im not 
 Before I didnt give a damn bout what they say 
 But I do 
 Promised that Ill never ever lie to you 
  
 So you can help 
 Taking the make-up off my face 
 Before I forget my own features 
  
 Im not here to let you down 
 But the costume makes the clown 
 Its just lashing out on me 
 Dont be so hard 
 Dont be so hard on this 
 Its your turn now 
 To cheat on me 
  
 Promises I made to you went down the sink 
 Really hope I havent harmed your self esteem 
 Im not a virgin but Im not the whore you think 
 And I dont always smell like strawberries and cream 
  
 So you can help 
 Taking the make-up off my face 
 Before I forget who I am now 
  
 Cause Im not here to let you down 
 But the costume makes the clown 
 Its just lashing out on me 
 Dont be so hard 
 Dont be so hard on this 
 Its your turn now 
 Your turn now 
  
 Im not here to let you down 
 But the costume makes the clown 
 Its just lashing out on me 
 Dont be so hard 
 Dont be so hard on this 
 Its your turn now 
 Your turn now 
  
 To cheat on me

 Anybody who been through the same thing im sure

 Ohh hey 
 Ive been travelin on this road too long too long 
 Just tryin find my way back home back home 
 But the old mes dead and gone 
 Dead and Gone, 
 And Ohh hey 
 Ive been travelin on this road too long too long 
 Just tryin find my way back home back home 
 But the old mes dead and gone, 
 Dead and Gone, dead and 
  
 Every had one of them days wish you would have stayed home 
 Run into a group of niggas who gettin their hate on 
 You walk by they get wrong 
 You reply then shit get blown 
 Way out of proportion way bad discussion 
 Just you against them pick one then rush them 
 Figure you get jumped here thats next 
 They dont wanna stop there now they bustin 
 Now you gushin ambulance rushin 
 You to the hospital with a bad concusion 
 Plus you hit four times but it hit yo spine 
 Paralyzed waist down and ya wheelchair bound 
 Never mind that now you lucky to be alive 
 Just thinkin it all started fussin wit three guys 
 proport way  proport way 
 around get shot down anyday 
 Niggas die everyday 
 All little bullshit, dope money, dice games, for their hood shit 
 Could this be cuz of hip-hop music 
 Or did the ones with the good sense not use it 
 Usually niggas dont know what to do when they back against the wall 
 So they just start shootin, 
 For red or for blue or for blow I guess, 
 From Bankhead at the old projects, 
 No more stress now Im straight, 
 Now I get it now I take time to think 
 before I make mistake just for my family stake, 
 That part of me left yesterday 
 The harder me is strong today 
 No regrets Im blessed to say the old me dead and gon away 
 Ohh hey 
 Ive been travelin on this road too long too long 
 Just tryin find my way back home back home 
 But the old mes dead and gone, 
 Dead and Gone, 
 And Ohh hey 
 Ive been travelin on this road too long too long 
 Just tryin find my way back home back home 
 But the old mes dead and gone, 
 Dead and Gone, 
 I aint neva been scared I live through tragic, 
 Situations could been dead lookin back at it, 
 Most of that shit didnt even have to happen, 
 But you think about it when you out there trappin 
 In the appartments hangin, smokin and rappin 
 Niggas start shit next thing we know we cappin 
 Get locked up then didnt even get mad 
 Now I think about that what a life I had 
 Most of that shit look back just laugh 
 Some shit still look back get sad 
 Thinkin my home boy still be around 
 had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time 
 I won that fight I lost that war 
 I could still see my nigga walkin out that door 
 Who would of thought Id never see Philant no more 
 Got enough dead homies I dont want no more 
 Cuz a nigga his jump cost me more 
 Id a took that ass whoppin out for sure 
 Now think before I risk my life 
 Take them chances to get my stripes 
 A nigga put his hands on me alright 
 Otherwise stand there talk shit all night 
 Cuz I hit you and you sue me 
 I shoot you get locked up poor me 
 No more stress now Im straight 
 Now I get it now I take time to think 
 before I make mistake just for my family stake 
 That part of me left yesterday 
 The harder me is strong today 
 No regrets Im blessed to say the old me dead and gon away 
 Ohh hey 
 Ive been travelin on this road too long too long

 Dead and Gone, 
 And Ohh hey 
 Ive been travelin on this road too long too long 
 Just tryin find my way back home back home 
 But the old mes dead and gone 
 Dead and Gone, dead and 
 I turn my head to the east 
 I dont see nobody by my side 
 I turn my head to the west, 
 still nobody in sight 
 So I turn my head to the north 
 swallow that pill that they call pride 
 That old me dead and gone 
 but the new me will be alright 
 I turn my head to the east 
 I dont see nobody by my side 
 I turn my head to the west still nobody in sight 
 So I turn my head to the north

 That old me dead and gone

 Just tryin find my way back home back home 
 But the old mes dead and gone 
 Dead and Gone, 
 And Ohh hey

 Feeling bad and looking thin 
 Holding on and holding in

 Dont play with my heart who am I 
  
 I address this letter to dear Father 
 I know you was complete unknown 
 I guess its better, you dont bother 
 All our truths should be left alone 
 be left alone 
 be left alone 
  
 I learned the things you never showed me 
 Took the chances youd a blown 
 And to this day 
 The one and only 
 You remain a complete unknown 
 complete unknown 
 complete unknown 
  
 Youre out there somewhere 
 I dont know if you care at all 
 It seems that you dont 
 Its as if the day will never come 
 So you remain a complete unknown 
  
 So many years have been ignored 
 Youve been gone without a trace 
 Im getting used to knowing your 
 Just a name without a face 
 without a face 
 without a face 
  
 Youre out there somewhere 
 I dont know if you care, at all 
 It seems that you dont 
 Its as if the day will never come 
 So you remain a complete unknown 
  
 Youre out there somewhere 
 I dont know if you care at all 
 It seems that you dont 
 Its as if the day will never come 
 So you remain a complete unknown 
  
 I address this letter to dear Father 
 I know you was complete unknown 
 I guess its better, you dont bother 
 All our truths should be left alone 
 Youre out there somewhere 
 I dont know if you care, at all 
 It seems that you dont 
 Its as if the day will never come 
 So you remain a complete unknown 
  
 Youre out there somewhere 
 I dont know if you care, at all 
 It seems that you dont 
 Its as if the day will never come 
 So you remain a complete unknown 
  
 Youre out there somewhere 
 I dont know if you care 
 You may push me around 
  
 But you cannot win 
  
 You may throw me down 
  
 But Ill rise again 
  
 The more you say 
  
 The more I defy you 
  
 So get out of my face 
  
 You cannot stop us 
 You cannot bring us down 
  
 Never give up 
  
 We go on and on 
  
 Youll never break us 
  
 Never bring us down 
  
 We are alive! 
  
 The wind blows 
  
 Ill lean into the wind 
  
 My anger grows 
  
 Ill use it to win 
  
 The more you say 
  
 The more I defy you 
  
 So get out of my way 
  
 All my will 
  
 All my strength 
  
 Rip it out 
  
 Start again 
  
 You cannot stop us, 
 you cannot bring us down 
 Never give up we go on and on 
  
 Youll never break us, never bring us down 
 We are alive 
  
 All my will 
  
 All my strength 
  
 Rip it out 
  
 Start again 
  
 All my will 
  
 All my strength 
  
 Rip it out 
  
 Start again 
  
 Can you leave it all behind? 
  
 Can you leave it all behind? 
  
 Cause you cant go back 
  
 You cant go back 
 You cannot stop us 
 You cannot bring us down 
 Never give up 
 We go on and on 
 Youll never break us 
 Never bring us down 
 We are alive! 
 Walk away when youre angry 
 Brace yourself, theres nothing to gain 
 Old enough to know the outcome 
 More blood, its always the same 
 Arent we cool and arent we calm 
 For facing death we run head-on 
 Arent we cool and arent we calm 
 For god weve suffered for so long 
 Arent we cool and arent we calm 
 For facing death we run head-on 
 Do what they say 
 Or they take it away 
 Id rather be dead then carry on 
  
 wait Bite your lip, dont be cursing 
 we must We musnt take Gods name in vain 
 in vain Blunt your knife, pull the curtain 
 impulse Impulses you must refrain 
 Arent we cool and arent we calm 
 For facing death we run head-on 
 Arent we cool and arent we calm 
 For god weve suffered for so long 
 Arent we cool and arent we calm 
 For facing death we run head-on 
 Do what they say 
 Or they take it away 
 Id rather be dead then carry on 
 Somebody carry on with this burden 
 I cant remember anything 
 I cant be certain 
  
 Arent we cool and arent we calm 
 For facing death we run head-on 
 Do what they say 
 Or they take it away 
 Id rather be dead then carry on

 Now everybody do the propaganda 
 And sing along in the age of paranoia

 I peek into the hole, I struggle for control 
 The children love the show, 
 but they fail to see the anguish in my eyes 
 Fail to see the anguish in my eyes 
 I scratch around the brim, I let my mind give in 
 The crowd begins to grin, 
 but they seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes 
 Seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes, its no surprise 
 Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic 
 My big top tricks will always make you happy, 
 but we all know the hat is wearing me 
 My bag is in the hat, its filled with this and that 
 My visions getting fat, the rabbits just a monkey in disguise 
 Skulls and pills and needles dance before our eyes 
 They will bite the hand if it is slower than 
 the quickness of their scrutinizing eyes 
 Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic 
 My big top tricks will always make you happy, 
 but we all know the hat is wearing me 
 Chicanery will always make you happy, 
 but we all know the hat is wearing me

 Im not afraid to take a stand 
 Everybody come take my hand I guess 
 Well walk this road together, through the storm 
 Whatever weather, cold or warm 
 Just let you know that, youre not alone 
 Hola if you feel that youve been down the same road 
 You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay em 
 But you wont take this thing out these words before I say em 
 Cause aint no way Im let you stop me from causing mayhem 
 When I say em or do something I do it, I dont give a damn 
 What you think, Im doing this for me, so fuck the world 
 Feed it beans, its gassed up, if a things stopping me 
 Imma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly 
 And all those who look down on me Im tearing down your balcony 
 No if ands or buts dont try to ask him why or how can he 
 From Infinite down to the last Relapse album hes still shit and 
 Whether hes on salary, paid hourly 
 Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him 
 Whichever comes first, for better or worse 
 Hes married to the game, like a fuck you for christmas 
 His gift is a curse, forget the earth hes got the urge 
 To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the universe 
  
 Im not afraid to take a stand 
 Everybody come take my hand 
 Well walk this road together, through the storm 
 Whatever weather, cold or warm 
 Just let you know that, youre not alone 
 Holla if you feel that youve been down the same road 
 Ok quit playin with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap 
  
 I shouldnt have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know its a rap 
 You said you was king, you lied through your teeth 
 For that fuck your feelings, instead of getting crowned youre getting capped 
 And to the fans, Ill never let you down again, Im back 
 I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact 
 Lets be honest, that last Relapse CD was ehhhh 
 Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground 
 Relax, I aint going back to that now 
  
 All Im tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW 
 Cause I aint playin around 
 Theres a game called circle and I dont know how 
 Im way too up to back down 
 But I think Im still tryna figure this crap out 
 Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didnt 
 This fucking black clouds still follows me around 
 But its time to exercise these demons 
 These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now! 
 Im not afraid to take a stand 
 Everybody come take my hand 
 Well walk this road together, through the storm 
 Whatever weather, cold or warm 
 Just let you know that, youre not alone 
 Holla if you feel that youve been down the same road 
  
 And I just cant keep living this way 
 So starting today, Im breaking out of this cage 
 Im standing up, Imma face my demons 
 Im manning up, Imma hold my ground 
 Ive had enough, now Im so fed up 
 Time to put my life back together right now 
  
 It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me 
 Admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you 
 So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through 
 And dont even realise what you did, believe me you 
 I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger 
 I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of 
 My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead 
 No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise 
 To focus soley on handling my responsibilitys as a father 
 So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it 
 You couldnt lift a single shingle lonely 
 Cause the way I feel, Im strong enough to go to the club 
 Put a ??? and lift the whole liquor counter up 
 Cause Im raising the bar, I shoot for the moon 
 But Im too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and 
 Im not afraid to take a stand 
 Everybody come take my hand 
 Well walk this road together, through the storm 
 Whatever weather, cold or warm 
 Just let you know that, youre not alone 
 Holla if you feel that youve been down the same road

 Say your prayers little one 
 dont forget, my son 
 to include everyone 
 tuck you in, warm within 
 keep you free from sin 
 till the sandman he comes 
 sleep with one eye open 
 gripping your pillow tight 
 exit light 
 enter night 
 take my hand 
 off to never never land 
 somethings wrong, shut the light 
 heavy thoughts tonight 
 and they arent of snow white 
 dreams of war, dreams of liars 
 dreams of dragons fire 
 and of things that will bite 
 sleep with one eye open 
 gripping your pillow tight 
 exit light 
 enter night 
 take my hand 
 off to never never land 
 now I lay me down to sleep 
 pray the lord my soul to keep 
 if I die before I wake 
 pray the lord my soul to take 
 hush little baby, dont say a word 
 and never mind that noise you heard 
 its just the beast under your bed, 
 in your closet, in your head 
 exit light 
 enter night 
 grain of sand 
 exit light 
 enter night 
 take my hand 
 were off to never never land 
  
 Im gonna put it all behind me 
 Like nothing ever happened between us 
 Nothing ever took place between you and me 
 Yeah 
 Nothin ever happened 
 And if you see me walkin down the street 
 I wont even recognise you 
 Ill just erase you from my memory 
 Put it all behind me 
 Because you are erased 
 All erased 
  
 Youll be sittin on someone elses couch 
 Youll be eatin off a strangers plate 
 Everything is gonna get wiped out 
 Like a new start 
 Like a brand new fresh clean slate 
 Well here I go remembering again 
 All the anger and the blame 
 People in glass houses shouldnt throw those stones 
 But something just flew through my window pane 
 My my my myoh mama did it touch you well 
  
 Ill be in a brand new pair of running shoes 
 And youll be walking on down different street 
 In a brand new suit and a fresh clean shirt 
 Makin telephone calls 
 Keepin in time with someone elses feet 
 Keepin in time with someone elses feet

 Youre the infection my friend 
 Disgusting right to the end 
 Didnt I know it then? 
 I knew it, I knew it 
 Youre basic, but hard to define 
 Simple yet somehow sublime 
 Knew you would strike again 
 I knew it, I knew it 
 Youre all thats wrong 
 With your dumbass song 
 Yet thats all that you will ever be 
 Nothing you can do cause 
 Thats all that you will ever be 
 Polished, you shimmer when shined 
 But rotten and seething inside 
 Everyone falls for this 
 I knew it, I knew it 
 Youre all thats wrong 
 With your dumbass song 
 Yet thats all that you will ever be 
 Nothing you can do cause 
 Thats all that you will 
 Thats all that you will 
 Thats all that you will ever be 
  
 Ever be, never be, want to be god 
 All to be, made to be, holding the son 
 Throwing it, breaking it, over your grave 
 Sending you back to the place you once came 
 It must be hard to be you 
 Nothings alright with you 
 Youre all thats wrong 
 With your dumbass song 
 Yet thats all that you will ever be 
 Nothing you can do cause 
 Thats all that you will ever be 
  
 Ever be/never be/wannabe Repeat 
 You will never be Repeat 
 You want to be God Repeat 
 Its all God Repeat 
 Its all gone Repeat 
 faint 
 Im diggin with my fingertips 
 Im gripping at the ground I stand upon 
 Im searching for fragile bones 
 Evolution 
 Im never gonna be refined 
 Keep trying but I wont assimilate 
 Should we have come far in time 
 Watch the ground break 
 And Im sorry that I dont believe 
 By the evidence that I see 
 That theres any hope left for me 
 Its evolution 
 Just evolution 
 And I, I do not dare deny 
 The basic beast inside 
 Its right here 
 Its controlling my mind 
 And why do I deserve to die 
 Im dominated by 
 This animal thats locked up inside 
 Close up to get a real good view 
 Im betting that the species will survive 
 Hold tight, Im getting inside you 
 Evolution 
 And when were gonna find these bones 
 Theyre gonna want to keep them in a jar 
 The number one virus caused by 
 Procreation 
 And the planet may go astray 
 In a million years theyll say 
 Those motherfuckers were all derranged 
 Its evolution 
 Just evolution 
 And I, I do not dare deny 
 The basic beast inside 
 Its right here 
 Its controlling my mind 
 And why do I deserve to die 
 Im dominated by 
 This animal thats locked up inside 
 Take a look around take a look around 
 Nothing much has changed 
 Take a look around take a look around 
 Nothing much has changed 
 Take a look around 
 Take a look around 
 Take a look around 
 Nothing much has changed 
 Take a look around 
 Take a look around 
 Nothing much has changed 
 Take a look around 
 Take a look around 
 Nothing much has changed 
 Take a look around 
 I, I do not dare deny 
 The basic beast inside 
 Its right here 
 Its controlling my mind 
 And why do I deserve to die 
 Im dominated by 
 This animal thats locked up inside 
 Why why why why fading 
 Why do I deserve to die? do I deserve to die fading 
 Why why why fading 
 Little thing little thing 
 What are you gonna  do 
 im drawn into your big black pool 
 it comes in waves 
 it comes in waves 
 the waves could pull me in 
 im blocked inside your ghost again 
 and heres the next thing 
 heres the next thing 
 in a car 
 in a car 
 its faster than you think 
 in a life that covers everything 
 bathed in white 
 bathed in red 
 and then the red turns into back 
 moving in for the attack 
 and heres the next thing 
 heres the next thing 
 heres the next thing 
 the next thing 
 its the one that calls me back again 
 everytime 
 everytime it comes and leavs a trace 
 and the mark is one you cant erase 
 it always stays it always stays 
 until it leaves me bare and underneath this sea of air 
 heres the next thing 
 the next thing 
 its the next thing 
 the next thing 
 its the next thing 
 the next thing 
 The more of you that I inspect 
 The more of me I see reflect 
 The more I try to read your lips 
 The more the mask youre wearing rips 
 But when I seek out your voice 
 My ears are overcome with noise 
 You show and tell with greatest ease 
 Raving impossibilities 
  
 Engaged in crime I grasp my throat 
 Enraged my mind starts to smoke 
 Enforce a mental overload 
 Angry again, angry again, angry ow 
 And when the story takes a twist 
 If folds like a contortionist 
 Slight of hand and quick exchange 
 The old tricks have been rearranged 
  
 Engaged in crime I grasp my throat 
 Enraged my mind starts to smoke 
 Enforce a mental overload 
 Angry again, angry again, angry 
 The searing of the sinew 
 My body fights for air 
 The ripping of the tissue 
 My lungs begin to tear 
 Gravitys got my bones 
 It pulls my flesh away 
 The steam finally dissipates 
 I make out my sweaty face 
  
 Association that I choose 
 Game I inevitably lose 
 Governed by laws set up by me 
 Fracture its jaw to let me be 
 A cut-out cardboard condo maze 
 Filled with an insubordinate race 
 Irrational youths stop to stare 
 As music rubber hosed the air 
  
 Engaged in crime I grasp my throat 
 Enraged my mind starts to smoke 
 Enforce a mental overload 
 Angry again, angry again, angry again 
 And again and again, again 
 Engaged in crime I grasp my throat 
 Enraged my mind starts to smoke 
 Enforce a mental overload 
 Angry again, angry again, angry ow 
  
 Insane - Am I the only muthafucker with a brain?

 How many times have you wanted to kill 
 Everything and everyone - Say youll do it but never will

 Enjoy the Slipknot 
 Storming through the party 
 Like my name was El ninio 
 When Im hangin out drinkin 
 In the back of an El camino 
 As a kid, I was a skid and 
 No-one knew me by name 
 I trashed my own house party 
 Cause nobody came 
 I know Im not the 
 One you thought you knew 
 Back in high school 
 Never going, ever showing up 
 When we had to 
 Is it attention that we crave 
 Dont tell us to behave 
 Im sick of always hearing 
 "Act your age" 
 I dont want 
 To waste my time 
 And become a 
 Casualty of society 
 Ill never fall in line 
 Become a victim 
 Of your conformity 
 And back down 
 Be-cause, you dont 
 Know us at all 
 We laugh when old people fall 
 But what would you expect 
 With a conscience so small 
 Heavy metal and mullets 
 Its how we were raised 
 Maiden and priest 
 Were the Gods that we praised 
 Cause we like having fun 
 At other peoples expense and, 
 Cutting people down is 
 Just a minor offence then 
 Its none of your concern 
 I guess Ill never learn 
 Im sick of being told to 
 "Wait my turn" 
 I dont want 
 To waste my time 
 And become a 
 Casualty of society 
 Ill never fall in line 
 Become a victim 
 Of your conformity 
 And back down 
 Dont count on me 
 To let you know when 
 Dont count on me 
 Ill do it again 
 Dont count on me 
 Its the point youre missing 
 Dont count on me 
 Cause Im not listening 
 Well Im a no goodnick 
 Lower middle class brat, 
 Back packed and I dont 
 Give a sht about nothing 
 You be standing on the corner 
 Talking all that kufuffin 
 But you dont make sense from 
 All the gas you be huffing 
 Then if the egg dont stain 
 Youll be ringing off the hook, 
 Youre on the hit list wanted 
 In the telephone book 
 I like songs with distortion 
 To drink in proportion 
 The doctor said my mom 
 Should have had an abortion 
 I dont want 
 To waste my time 
 And become a 
 Casualty of society 
 Ill never fall in line 
 Become a victim 
 Of your conformity 
 And back down 
 Waste my time with them 
 Casualty of society 
 Waste my time again, 
 Victim of your conformity 
 And back down 
 Not like I need to depend upon anyone 
 Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all 
 One more anthem for the know it all 
 I wont be standing up for long I better learn how to crawl 
 In ten minutes Ill be laying out flat on the floor 
 Like I need to defend my own innocence 
 So what, I did it, I admit it, and Im pleading the 5th 
 One more anthem for the know it all 
 I wont be standing up for long I better learn how to crawl 
 In ten minutes Ill be laying out flat on the floor 
 8 minutes from losing it a little bit 
 5 minutes your description might be starting to fit 
 3 to go and Im forgetting all that Ive ever known 
 I wont be standing up for long I better learn how to crawl 
 Not like I need to depend upon anyone 
 Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all 
 One more anthem for the know it all 
 I wont be standing up for long I better learn how to crawl 
 In ten minutes Ill be laying out flat on the floor 
 I cant stand up at all 
 Cant see nothing at all 
 In ten minutes Ill be laying out flat on the floor 
 Gimme fuel, gimme fire 
 Gimme that which I desire 
 Oh 
 Yeah 
 Turn on, I see red 
 Adrenaline crash and crack my head 
 Nitro junkie, paint me dead 
 And I see red 
 I run across through black and white 
 War horse, war head 
 Fuck em, man 
 White knuckle tight 
 Through black and white 
 When I burn 
 Fuel is pumping engines 
 Burning hard 
 Loose and clean 
 And then I burn 
 Turning my direction 
 Quench my thirst with gasoline 
 So gimme fuel, gimme fire 
 Gimme that which I desire 
 Yeah 
 Turn on beyond the bone 
 Swallow future, spit out hope 
 Burn your face upon the chrome 
 Yeah, oh yeah 
 Take the corner, going to crash 
 Headlights 
 Headlines 
 Another junkie, who lives too fast 
 Yeah, lives way too fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast 
 Oh 
 When I burn 
 Fuel is pumping engines 
 Burning hard 
 Loose and clean 
 And then I burn 
 Turning my direction 
 Quench my thirst with gasoline 
 So gimme fuel, gimme fire 
 Gimme that which I desire 
 Oh yeah 
 White knuckle tight 
 Gimme fuel 
 Gimme fire 
 My desire 
 When I burn 
 Fuel is pumping engines 
 Burning hard 
 Loose and clean 
 And on and on 
 Turning my direction 
 Quench my thirst with gasoline 
 Gimme fuel, gimme fire 
 Gimme that which I desire 
 Oh 
 On I burn 
 when we were making the first Linkin Park record 
 He was like, 
 "Yeah you know, I dont know about the rapping like, 
 I dont know maybe you should just be a rock band" 
 You know what I mean, like, trying to change us 
 like they signed us as an act like what we sound like and then hes like 
 "Oh I dont know maybe you should just play keyboard" 
  
 Before the first song that you heard me on 
 There were people already tryin to get me gone 
 Tellin me to quit rapping 
 "Just play the keys" 
 That my band had a singer 
 They didnt need me 
 But my band had my back 
 So we did the tracks 
 Put out the album and the talk went flat 
 It was funny at first but then the humour faded 
 When some magazines printed that our label made us 
 We were to be good to be true 
 Some were saying ghost writers were writin all that we do 
 So we had to disprove it 
 We spelled it out to the detail how we do it when were making this music 
 After that I made it a rule 
 I only do e-mail responses to print interviews 
 Because these people love to put a twist to your words 
 To infer that you said something fucking absurd 
  
 Oh, did I lose you at infer? 
 Not used to hearing a verse that uses over first grade vocabulary words? 
 People used to infer that we were manufactured 
 Now Ive got the interviews on file 
 Which people said what 
 Which number to dial 
 So now every enemy screaming insanity 
 All theyre ever gonna bes another big fan of me 
 Bitch

 Im going through changes 
 Im going through changes 
  
 Lately I really, feel like Im rolling for  like Philly, 
 I feel like Im losing control of myself, I sincerely, 
 I apologize if all that I sound like, is Im complaining, 
 But life keeps on complicating, an Im debating, 
 On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls, 
 Can see Im grievin, I try and hide it, 
 But I cant, why do I act like Im all high and mighty, 
 When inside, Im dying, I am finally realizing I need help 
 I cant do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks Ive been having ups and downs, 
 Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying, 
 Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here 
 Im hatin my reflection, I walk around the house tryin to fight mirrors, 
 I cant stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care? 
 I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie, 
 Im afraid if I close my eyes I might see her, 
 Shit 
  
 Im going through changes 
 Im going through changes 
  
 I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin at noon, 
 Yeah dads in a bad mood, hes always snappin at you 
 Marshall what happened at you, you cant stop with these pills, 
 And youve fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughin at you 
 It become a problem youre too pussy to tackle, get up, 
 Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled 
 Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed, 
 They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust, 
 Nah, it aint like Doody to do that, 
 He wouldnt fuckin shoot at, no-body, he fights first, 
 But dwellin on it only makes the night worse, 
 Now Im poppin Vics, perks and Methadone pills 
 Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it, 
 Fuckin drug dealers hang around me like "yes man", 
 And they gon do whatever I says when, I says it, 
 Its in their best interest to protect their investment 
 And I just lost my fuckin best friend, so fuck it, I guess then 
  
 Im going through changes 
 Dont know what Im going through, but I just keep on going through changes 
  
 My friends just cant understand this new me, 
 Thats understandable man, but just think how bananas youd be, 
 Youd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo 
 And everybodys lookin at you, what you want me to do, 
 Im startin to live like a recluse and the truth is, 
 Fame startin to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low 
 I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin the same damn DVD, 
 Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive 
 And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin pillsll make me feel alright 
 And if Im still awake in the middle of the night, 
 I just take a couple more, yeah youre motherfuckin right, 
 I aint slowin down for no one, I am almost homeward bound 
 Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on, dont look now, 
 Daddy, dont you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground 
 Fuck, dont I know the sound of that voice, 
 Yeah baby hold me down 
  
 Im going through changes 
 Dont know what Im going through, but I just keep on going through changes 
  
 Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, plus somehow Im pullin through 
 Swear when I come back Ima be bulletproof 
 Ima do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few, 
 Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth 
 shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through? 
 I think about the things I would never got to say to you, 
 Id never get to make it right, so heres what I came to do 
 Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too, 
 I still love your mother, thatll never change, 
 Think about her every day, we just could never get it together 
 Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it, 
 But I swear on everything, Id do anything for her on anyday 
 There are just too many things, to explain, when it rains, 
 Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasnt any pain 
 But I cant pretend there aint, I aint placin any blame, 
 I aint pointin fingers, heaven knows there never been a saint 
 I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history, 
 But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say, 
 I miss you self consciously, wish it didnt end this way 
 But I just had to get away, dont know why, 
 I dont know what else to say, I guess Im 
  
 Im going through changes 
 Dont know what Im going through, but I just keep on going through changes

 END  
 What you sees not what you get 
 With you theres just no measurement 
 No way to tell whats real from what isnt there 
 Your eyes they sparkle 
 Thats all changed into lies that drop like acid rain 
 You washed away the best of me 
 You dont care 
 You know you did it 
 Im gone 
 To find someone to live for 
 In this world 
 Theres no light at the end of the tunnel tonight 
 Just a bridge that I gotta burn 
 Youre wrong 
 If you think you can walk right through my door 
 That is just so you 
 Coming back when Ive finally moved on 
 Im already gone 
 Sometimes shattered 
 Never open 
 Nothing matters 
 When youre broken 
 That was me whenever I was with you 
 Always ending 
 Always over 
 Back and forth, up and down like a rollercoaster 
 I am breaking 
 That habit 
 Today 
 You know you did it 
 Im gone 
 To find someone to live for 
 In this world 
 Theres no light at the end of the tunnel tonight 
 Just a bridge that I gotta burn 
 Youre wrong 
 If you think you can walk right through my door 
 That is just so you 
 Coming back when Ive finally moved on 
 Im already gone 
 There is nothing you can say 
 Sorry doesnt cut it, babe 
 Take the hint and walk away 
 Cause Im gone 
 Doesnt matter what you do 
 Its what you did thats hurting you 
 All I needed was the truth 
 Now Im gone 
 What you sees not what you get 
 What you sees not what you get 
 You know you did it 
 Im gone 
 To find someone to live for 
 In this world 
 Theres no light at the end of the tunnel tonight 
 Just a bridge that I gotta burn 
 You were wrong 
 If you think you can walk right through my door 
 That is just so you 
 Coming back when Ive finally moved on 
 Im already gone 
 Im already gone 
 Oh, Im already gone, gone, gone, gone 
 Already gone 
 Im gone 
 Im goin home, gonna load my shotgun 
 Wait by the door and light a cigarette 
 If he wants a fight well now hes got one 
 And he aint seen me crazy yet 
 He slap my face and he shook me like a rag doll 
 Dont that sound like a real man 
 Im going to show him what a little girls made of 
 Gunpowder and lead 
 Its half past ten, another six pack in 
 And I can feel the rumble like a cold black wind 
 He pulls in the drive, the gravel flies 
 He dont know whats waiting here this time 
 Im goin home, gonna load my shotgun 
 Wait by the door and light a cigarette 
 If he wants a fight well now hes got one 
 And he aint seen me crazy yet 
 He slap my face and he shook me like a rag doll 
 Dont that sound like a real man 
 Im going to show him what a little girls made of 
 Gunpowder and lead 
 His fist is big but my guns bigger 
 Hell find out when I pull the trigger 
 Im goin home, gonna load my shotgun 
 Wait by the door and light a cigarette 
 If he wants a fight well now hes got one 
 And he aint seen me crazy yet 
 He slap my face and he shook me like a rag doll 
 Dont that sound like a real man 
 Im going to show him what a little girls made of 
 Gunpowder and lead 
 You said it once before 
 you dont do those things you used to anymore 
 You say in doubt 
 were fading out 
 forgetting who we used to be 
 Cause I will bring you down 
 I dont want to miss 
 I dont think you can handle this 
 Youve lost what you cant find 
 its never what you had in mind 
 You take it with a smile 
 its so easy when youre always in denial 
 Just in time 
 but out of line I cant make 
 all the same mistakes you want me to 
 Cause I will bring you down 
 I dont want to miss 
 I dont think you can handle this 
 Youve lost what you cant find 
 its never what you had in mind 
 Your giving up 
 you know its not what you need 
 And its true what youre going through 
 Try so hard not listen to 
 everything I never say 
 Cause I will bring you down, 
 I dont want to miss, 
 I dont think you can handle this 
 Cause I will bring you down, 
 I dont want to miss, 
 I dont think you can handle this 
 Youve lost what you cant find 
 its never what you had in mind 
 Im getting over getting used to 
 And after all that I put you through 
 now I see Im not the only one 
 I never thought Itd ever come to 
 This in fact was never what you 
 wanted from me 
 or how you meant it to be 
 Im getting over getting used to 
 And after all that I put you through 
 now I see Im not the only one 
 I never thought Itd ever come to 
 This in fact was never what you 
 wanted from me 
 or how you meant it to be 
  
 I can hardly wait 
 I can hardly wait 
 I can hardly wait 
 I can hardly wait 
 Its been so long Ive lost my taste 
 Say angel come, say lick my face 
 Let fall your dress, 
 Ill play the part, 
 Ill open this mouth wide, eat your heart 
 I can hardly wait 
 I can hardly wait 
 I can hardly wait 
 I can hardly wait 
 Lips cracked dry 
 Tongue blue burst 
 Say angel come,Said lick my thirst 
 Its been so long Ive lost my taste 
 Here Romeo, make my world as great 
 In my glass coffin, I am waiting 
 In my glass coffin, I am waiting 
 In my glass coffin, I am waiting 
 The prophets of God have left you solaced indeed 
 A zombie of Jesus insane with his belief 
 Is all that you know and all you take as you go 
 Youre one with the rich and only take from the poor 
 Nailed to the cross by your hands and your feet 
 Your washed up religion is now worthless and weak 
 Tenacious conviction has caught up with your soul 
 Theres no place for mercy in the myths of your lord 
  
 Little lamb of sacrifice, full of Bible hymns 
 Hiding in the house of God, from his suffering 
 Pray the son will come and call just to make us dead 
 Bring upon the end of times orship if you dare 
  
 Wiping out masses just for shits and a grin 
 Is all an illusion of the spell that youre in 
 Religious confliction has impaired your control 
 In his resurrection, revelations unfold 
  
 He is you the sacrifice, in the house of bless 
 Crucify yourself to death just to get to him 
 Die? will you? 
  
 Annihilation by the hands of God 
 Mutilate me? 
 Annihilation by the hands of God 
 Unforgiving? 
  
 Annihilation by the hands of God 
 Christ ill willing? 
  
 Annihilation by the hands of God 
 Heaven hates you? 
  
 When its time, I wont look back 
 Heavens gates under attack 
  
 Satan? 
 Satan? 
  
 Satan? 
  
 Satan? 
  
 Little lamb of sacrifice, full of Bible hymns 
 Hiding in the house of God, from his suffering 
 Pray the son will come and call just to make us dead 
 Bring upon the end of times? worship if you dare 
 Annihilation by the hands of God 
 Mutilate me? 
 Annihilation by the hands of God 
 Unforgiving? 
 Annihilation by the hands of God 
 Christ ill willing? 
 Annihilation by the hands of God 
 Heaven hates you 
 he sewed his eyes shut because he was afraid to see 
 he tries to tell me what i pit inside of me 
 hes got the answers to ease my curiosity 
 he dreamed a god up and called it christianity 
 you god is dead and no one cares 
 if there is a hell i will see you there 
 he flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line 
 he made a virus that would kill off all the swine 
 his perfect kingdom of killing, suffering and pain 
 demands devotion atrocities done in his name 
 you gos is dead and no one cares 
 and if there is a hell i will see you there 
 you gos is dead and no one cares 
 and if there is a hell i will see you there 
 I took my lover to the sea 
 Drowned him precious bride to be 
 Bleeding heaven from the start 
 Woe is rapture ripped apart 
 Hey youre honest, arent you? 
 Show me rapture torn apart 
 Everybodys riddled with disease 
 But I bet you say, "not me" 
 So honest, arent you? 
 Youre so honest, arent you so? 
  
 My, arent you 
 Surely the finest of the brigade? 
 My, arent you 
 Always right a portrait of dignity? 
 My, arent you 
 Innocent and never suspectable 
 My, arent you 
  
 Wait 
 You smell like sht, not the truth 
 Full of device, not devotion 
 Conscience came right up to you 
 And then you threw it back 
 You are the scum of the earth 
 You are the scum of the ocean 
 To you its above as below 
 You smear your filth across the world 
 You smear your filth across the world 
 You smear your filth across the world 
 You smear your filth across the world 
  
  
 Feeling the ride, dont wanna run away, baby dont hide 
 Seek and youll find, when I close my eyes 
 Were counting the moments so come with me now 
  
 Lets go outside 
  
 Falling down like rain, falling down like rain 
  
 A twist in my mind whenever you call my name, come for me now 
 I dont wanna hide, the taste of your love 
 Is sweeter than ever, now come and taste mine 
 Seek and youll find 
 Falling down like rain, falling down like rain 
  
 Hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek, hide 
  
 Feeling the ride, a twist in my mind, the taste of your love 
  
 Come and taste mine, seek and youll find 
 Falling down like rain, falling down like rain 
  
 Falling down like rain00:5250No life till leather 
 We are gonna kick some ass tonight 
 We got the metal madness 
 When our fans start screaming 
 Its right well alright 
 When we start to rock 
 We never want to stop again 
 Hit the lights 
 Hit the lights 
 Hit the lights 
 You know our fans are insane 
 We are gonna blow this place away

 Than anything today the only way 
 When we start to rock

 We are gonna rip right through your brain 
 We got the lethal power 
 It is causing you sweet pain Oh sweet pain 
 When we start to rock 
 We never want to stop again 
 Hit the lights 
 Hit the lights 
 Hit the lights 
 Hit the lights 
 Hear the sound of the falling rain 
 Coming down like an Armageddon plague Hey! 
 The shame, the ones who die without a name 
  
 Hear the dogs howlin out of key 
 To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" 
 A blead, the company lost the war today 
  
 I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 
 This is the dawning of the rest of our lives 
 On holiday 
  
 Theres a drum pounding out of time 
 Another protestor has crossed the line Hey! 
 To find the moneys on the other side 
  
 Can I get another Amen Amen 
 Theres a flag wrapped around the score of men HEY! 
 A gag, A plastic bag on a monument 
  
 I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 
 This is the dawning of the rest of our lives 
 On holiday 
  
 "The representative from California has the floor" 
 "Zieg heil" to the president gasbag 
 Bombs away is your punishment 
 Pulverize the Eiffel tower 
 who criticize your government 
 Bang bang goes the broken glass 
 Kill all the fags that dont agree 
 Trials by fires, setting fire 
 Thats not a way thats meant for me 
 Just cause,Just cause because were outlaws yeah! 
 I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 
 This is the dawning of the rest of our lives 
 I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 
 This is the dawning of the rest of our lives 
 This is our lives on holiday 
 00:2966I know Ive seen some bad days 
 But I never thought it got that bad 
 Its only love thats been changed 
 But I never thought youd light the match 
 I need you every time that Im alone 
 I feel you please dont go 
  
 And I know you lied to hurt me 
 Say that Im not worthy 
 I pop another pill and I take another hit 
 So lets do it again 
 And I know you lied to hurt me 
 Say that Im not worthy 
 I pop another pill and I take another hit 
 And lets do it again 
  
 And now we go our separate ways 
 In a story that seems so sad 
 Am I distant memory 
 Like a stranger you never even met 
 I need you every time that Im alone 
 I feel you please dont go 
  
 And I know you lied to hurt me 
 Say that Im not worthy 
 I pop another pill and I take another hit 
 So lets do it again 
 And I know you lied to hurt me 
 Say that Im not worthy 
 I pop another pill and I take another hit 
 And lets do it again 
  
 And I know you lied to hurt me 
 Say that Im not worthy 
 I pop another pill and I take another hit 
 So lets do it again 
 And I know you lied to hurt me 
 Say that Im not worthy 
 I pop another pill and I take another hit 
 So lets do it again 
  
 I know you lied to hurt me 
 I know you lied to hurt me 
 I pop another pill I take another hit 
 So lets do it again

 Grab my gat, and load up the steel 
 And if you wanna get drastic 
 Ill pull out my blasted glock, automatic, 
 Synthetic material, bury your blocks-n-mortar 
 Headed down to da Mexican border 
 Smokin that smellie, Northern Cali, 
 Gonna put a slug in Captain OMalley 
 Ho, hum-Hear the gat come 
 Boooooommmmmm!

 But Ill be damned if I dont take a stand

 Dig the grave for the one who got played 
 Now hes under 
 Dont make me wonder why cause youll testify 
 We aint goin out like that 
  
 I got to thinkin "What the fuck is this?" 
 Lettin you know I take care of business 
 Can I get a witness? 
 To verify when Im to bring this style 
 That makes you ecstatic 
 Tragic, when I get a poof of the magic buddha 
 When I roll with my crew 
 I betcha one time cant find my hooda! 
 Hitsll be hitting with the belt unbuckled I dont know this line 
 Pig rollin up but he aint that subtle 
 Pulled to da curb 
 So we exchange a few words 
 But he got me stirred up 
 "Ought not to grab the handcuffs

  00:0430The whole world is my enemy - and im a walking target 
 Two times the devil with all the significance 
 Dragged and raped for the love of a mob 
 I cant stay - because i cant be stopped 
 Eat motherfuckers alive who cross us 
 I know youre all tired of the same ol bosses 
 Let me tell you how its gonna be 
 Im gonna kill anyone who steps up in front of me 
 Welcome to the same ol fucking scam 
 Same ol shit in a dead fad 
 Everybody wants to be so hard 
 Are you real or a second rate sports card? 
 They all lost their dad or their wife just died 
 They never got to go outside - shut up 
 Nobody gives a fuck 
 It doesnt change the fact that you suck 
 We are the anti-cancer 
 We are the only answer 
 Stripped down we want you dead 
 But whats inside of me youll never know 
 We are bipolar gods 
 We are you know what we are 
 My life was always shit 
 And i dont think i need this anymore 
  
 Now im not pretty and im not cool 
 But im fat and im ugly and proud - so fuck you 
 Standing out is the new pretension 
 Sreamline the ness half-assed aggression 
 You gotta see it to believe it we all got conned 
 All the mediocre sacred cows we spawne 
 Put your trust in the mission 
 We will not repent - this is our religion 
 We are the anti-cancer 
 We are the only answer 
 Stripped down we want you dead 
 But whats inside of me youll never know 
 We are bipolar gods 
 We are you know what we are 
 My life was always shit 
 And i dont think i need this anymore 
  
 I am hated 
 You are hated 
  
 We are hated 
  
 I am hated 
  
 Everything sucks and i can prove it 
 Everybody dies shuffle on remove it 
 Individuals indispensable 
 Im the paradox deity vessel 
 the other side holds no secret 
 But this side is done i dont need it 
 Before you go you should know youre breaking down 
 Youll be rotten by the time youre underground 
  
 We are the anti-cancer 
 We are the only answer 
 Stripped down we want you dead 
 But whats inside of me youll never know 
 We are bipolar gods 
 We are you know what we are 
 My life was always shit 
 And i dont think i need this anymore 
 We are the source of conscience 
 We are distorted sentients 
 Theres only one thing left 
 And i cant leave until its sated 
 We are the absolute 
 We are controlling you 
 Theyre closing in i cant escape 
 I am hated 
  
 Everytime we lie awake 
 After every hit we take 
 Every feeling that I get 
 But I havent missed you yet 
 Every roomate kept awake 
 By every silent scream we make 
 All the feelings that I get 
 But I still dont missed you yet 
 Only when I stop to think about it 
  
 I hate everything about you 
 Why do I love you 
 I hate everything about you 
 Why do I love you 
  
 Every time we lie awake 
 After every hit we take 
 Every feeling that I get 
 But I havent missed you yet 
 Only when I stop to think about it 
  
 I hate everything about you 
 Why do I love you 
 I hate everything about you 
 Why do I love you 
 Only when I stop to think about you 
 I know 
 Only when you stop to think about me 
 Do you know

 You hate everything about me 
 Why do you love me

 You love me 
  
 I hate everything about you 
 Why do I love you

 Eminem 
 I murder a rhyme one word at a time 
 You never, heard of a mind as perverted as mine 
 You better, get rid of that nine, it aint gonna help 
 What goods it gonna do against a man that strangles himself? 
 Im waitin for hell like hell shit Im anxious as hell 
 Manson, youre safe in that cell, be thankful its jail 
 I used to be my mommys little angel at twelve 
 Thirteen I was puttin shells in a gauge on a shelf 
 I used to, get punked and bullied on my block 
 til I cut a kittens head off and stuck it in this kids mailbox 
 "Mom! MOM!" I used to give a - fuck, now I could give a fuck less 
 What do I think of suc-cess? It sucks, too much press Im stressed 
 Too much stares two breasts, too upset 
 Its just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick yes 
 Grew up quick no was raised right 
 Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right 
 You think of my name now whenever you say, "Hi" 
 Became a commodity because Im W-H-I- 
 -T-E, cuz MTV was so friendly to me 
 Cant wait til Kim sees me 
 Now is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect? 
 Read my lips bitch, what, my mouth isnt workin? 
 You hear this finger? Oh its upside down 
 Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

 Eminem 
 I take each individual degenerates head and reach into it 
 just to see if hes influenced by me if he listens to music 
 And if he feeds into this shit hes an innocent victim 
 and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe 
  
 I been crazy way before radio didnt play me 
  
 With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible 
 Its Ken Kaniff on the, internet 
 Tryin to, lure your kids with him, into bed 
 Its a, sick world we live in these days 
 "Slim for Petes sakes put down Christopher Reeves legs!" 
 Geez, you guys are so sensitive 
 "Slim its a touchy subject, try and just dont mention it" 
 Mind with no sense in it, fried to get so frenetic 
 whose eyes get so squinted, Im blind from smokin em 
 with my windows tinted, with nine limos rented 
 Doin lines of coke in em, with a bunch of guys hoppin out 
  
 And thats where I get my name from, thats why they call me

 Eminem 
 I take seven kids from Columbine, stand em all in line 
 Add an AK-47, a revolver, a nine 
 a Mack-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine 
 and thats a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time 
 Cause Immmm Shady, they call me as crazy 
 as the world was over this whole Y2K thing 
 And by the way, NSync, why do they sing? 
 Am I the only one who realizes they stink? 
 Should I dye my hair pink and care what yall think? 
 Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings? 
 Its why I tend to block out when I hear things 
 Cause all these fans screamin is makin my ears ring AHHHH!!! 
 So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger 
 longer than the rumor that I was stickin it to Christina 
 Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz 
 itd be Jennifer Lopez, and Puffy you know this! 
 Im sorry Puff, but I dont give a fuck if this chick was my own mother 
 I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her 
 and have a son and a new brother at the same time 
 and just say that it aint mine, whats my name?

 Slim Shady, 2001 
  
 In my years, Ive seen all sounds of misconception 
 In my years, Ive done all I can live to question 
 What happened to me I dont understand 
 Ive seen all I can see as my time expands 
  
 Bored I am, bored of my own desperation, 
 I cant defend, cant find my own destination 
 What happened to me I dont understand 
 Ive seen all I can see as my time expands 
 So whats up with you, whats up with me 
 Im not the one I cant pretend, 
 What would I be if I did it all again 
  
 And I sometimes wish I would have asked some 
 Then maybe I would have a clearer life perception 
 Whats up with you, whats up with me 
 another time around 
 In my hour of need 
 Ha youre not there 
 And though I reached out for you 
 Wouldnt lend a hand 
  
 Through the darkest hour 
 Grace did not shine on me 
 It feels so cold very cold 
 No one cares for me 
  
 Did you ever think I get lonely 
 Did you ever think that I needed love 
 Did you ever think to stop thinking 
 Youre the only one that Im thinking of 
 Youll never know how hard I tried 
 To find my space and satisfy you too 
 Things will be better when Im dead and gone 
 Dont try to understand knowing you Im probably wrong 
 But oh how I lived my life for you 
 Still youd turn away 
 Now as I die for you 
 My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name 
 All these years I thought I was wrong 
 Now I know it was you 
 Raise your head raise your face your eyes 
 Tell me who you think you are who ? 
 I walk I walk alone 
 Into the promised land 
 Theres a better place for me 
 But its far far away 
 Everlasting life for me 
 In a perfect world 
 But I gotta die first 
 Please God send me on my way 
 Time has a way of taking time 
 Loneliness is not only felt by fools 
 Alone I call to ease the pain 
 Yearning to be held by you alone so alone Im lost 
 Consumed by the pain 
 The pain the pain the pain 
 Wont you hold me again 
 You just laughed ha ha bitch 
 My whole life is work built on the past 
 But the time has come when all things shall pass 
 This good thing passed away 
 Like youve been carrying a load 
  
 And you swear to me 
  
 You dont want to be my slave 
  
 But youre staring at me 
  
 Like I need to be saved  saved 
  
 Like I need to be saved  saved 
  
 In your jesus christ pose 
  
 jesus christ pose 
  
 Arms held out 
  
 In your jesus christ pose 
  
 Thorns and shroud 
  
 Like its the coming of the lord 
  
 And I swear to you 
  
 That I would never feed you pain 
  
 But youre staring at me mine 
  
 Like Im driving the nails 
  
 Like Im driving the nails 
  
 Like Im driving the nails 
  
 In your jesus christ 
  
 jesus christ 
  
 jesus christ 
  
 jesus christ  start  line 
  
 And you stare at me 
  
 In your jesus christ pose 
  
 Arms held out like its 
  
 The coming of the lord 
  
 And would it pay you more to walk on water 
  
 Than to wear a crown of thorns 
  
 It wouldnt pain me more to bury you rich 
  
 Than to bury you poor 
 Muthafucka u dont understand 
 All my hate! 
 Muthafucka u dont understand 
 All my rage! 
 Muthafucka u dont understand 
 All my pain! 
 Muthafucka u dont understand 
  
 You seem to sever all my frequencies 
 Im tethered to your energies 
 And everything turns inside out 
 I cant be killed but Im not too proud 
  
 Maybe you would like to peek through the curtain 
 At the same mistake you know you always make 
 Butall I really want to know is 
 Are you gonna lay the fuck back down 
 Or jump da fuck up? 
  
 Walking in da streets and looking at all this shit 
 Im full of hate, dont fuck with me 
 Walking in da streets and looking at all this shit 
 Open up your eyes and fucking see 
 We got the tribe against society 
 We got to fight the real enemy 
 Get da fuck up, stand da fuck up 
 Back da fuck up 
  
 All this is making things a bit insane 
 And I dont care who stares or stays 
 The only thing that matters is 
 Will you reach out if you cant resist? 
  
 Maybe you dont give a shit for the rest of us 
 But if you do, the time is now, if it ever was 
 If youre gonna fight, whatcha gonna do? 
 Jump da fuck up! 
  
 Muthafucka u dont understand 
 All my hate! 
 Muthafucka u dont understand 
 All my rage! 
 Muthafucka u dont understand 
 All my pain! 
 Muthafucka u dont understand 
  
 How dare you single out my honesty 
 Compare me to your travesties 
 I only want to see you fight 
 The darkness you wanna live your life by 
  
 And if youre gonna quit 
 I dont give a shit 
 What the fuck, Im a Mack truck 
 Are you gonna give up like a bitch 
 Or jump da fuck up? 
  
 Walking in da streets and looking at all this shit 
 Im full of hate, dont fuck with me 
 Walking in da streets and looking at all this shit 
 Open up your eyes and fucking see 
 We got the tribe against society 
 We got to fight the real enemy 
 Get da fuck up, stand da fuck up 
 Muthafuckaaaaaaaarrggghhhh 
  
 Im a self-destructive piece of shit 
 Smear me in 
 I dont owe you a goddamn thing 
 This life has never had the swing 
 I dont wanna be immortal or legend or anything 
 Cuz the longer Im alive, the better off youll be 
 Get ready for epitome, come on and pity me 
 Will you kill me if I say please? 
  
 Im the same old reasons not to try 
 What the hell 
 Beat to death with a shovel and a new smell 
 Come and get me, mom would never let me do it 
 Im ruined, I dont want anything from you 
 Cuz Ive got nothing left to prove, cmon 
 My time, everything feels fine, goodbye 
 Killing from the inside 
 Chab 
 ;  
  
 Enjoy the Slipknot 
  
 Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak 
 When you feel weak, you feel like you just wanna just give up 
 But you gotta search within you, try and find that inner strength 
 And just pull that shit out of you, and get that motivation not to give up 
 And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face 
  
 Till I collapse Im spillin these 
 raps long as you feel em 
 Till the day that I drop youll never say that Im not killin em 
 Cuz when I am not, then Ima stop pinnin them and I am not 
 hip-hop and Im not just Eminem 
 Subliminal thoughts, when Ima stop sendin 
 em, women are caught in webs, spin em and hock venom 
 Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not 
 Get the illin to stop, amoxacillins just not real enough 
 The criminal cop killin hip-hop villiana 
 Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners 
 Your comin with me, feel it or not youre gonna fear it 
 Like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us 
 You hear it a lot lyrics to shock, 
 Is it a miracle 
 Or am I just a product of pop fizzin up? 
 Fa shizzel my wizzel, this is the plot 
 Listen up, 
 You bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a  fuck 
 Till the roof comes off, 
 Till the lights go out 
 Till my leg give out 
 Cant shut my mouth 
 Till the smoke clears out 
 And my high burn out 
 Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse 
 Till the roof comes off 
 Till the lights go out 
 Till my legs give out 
 Cant shut my mouth 
 Till the smoke clears out 
 Am I high, perhaps? 
 Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse 
  
 Music is like magic, theres a certain feelin 
 You get when youre real, 
 And you spit and people are feelin ya shit 
 This is your moment and every single minute 
 You spend trynna hold on to it 
 cuz you may never get it again 
 So while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can 
 And when your run is over 
 Just admit when its at its end 
 Cuz Im at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in 
 I got a list 
 Heres the order of my list that its in 
 It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie 
 Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me 
 But in this industry, Im the cause of a lotta 
 Envy 
 So when Im not put on this list 
 The shit does not offend me 
 Thats why you see me walkin around like nothins 
 Botherin me, even though half 
 You people gotta fuckin problem with me 
 You hate it but you know respect you got to 
 Give me 
 The press wet dream like 
 Bobby and Whitney 
 Nate hit me 
 Till the roof comes off, 
 Till the lights go out 
 Till my leg give out 
 Cant shut my mouth 
 Till the smoke clears out 
 And my high burn out 
 Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse 
 Till the roof comes off 
 Till the lights go out 
 Till my legs give out 
 Cant shut my mouth 
 Till the smoke clears out 
 Am I high, perhaps 
 Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse 
  
 Soon as a verse starts I eat at an Emcees 
 Heart, what is he thinkin, how 
 Not to go against me, smart 
 And its absurd how people hang on every word 
 Ill probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve 
 But Ill never be served, my 
 Spot is forever reserved 
 If I ever leave Earth 
 That would be the death of me first 
 cuz in my heart of hearts I know nothin could 
 Ever be worse thats why Im 
 Clever when I put together every verse 
 My thoughts are sporadic, I act like 
 Im an addict 
 I rap like Im addicted to smack, 
 Like Im Kim Mathers 
 But I dont wanna go forth and back in constant battles 
 The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers 
 So this is like a full blown attack Im launchin 
 On them, the track is on some 
 Battlin rap who wants some static 
 Cuz I dont really think that the fact that 
 Im Slim matters 
 A plague and platinum status is wack if Im not the baddest so 
 Till the roof comes off, 
 Till the lights go out 
 Till my leg give out 
 Cant shut my mouth 
 Till the smoke clears out 
 And my high burn out 
 Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse 
 Till the roof comes off 
 Till the lights go out 
 Till my legs give out 
 Cant shut my mouth 
 Till the smoke clears out 
 Am I high, perhaps? 
 Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse 
  
 Until the roof, Until the roof 
 the roof comes off The roof comes off 
 Until my legs, Until my legs 
 give out from underneath me, 
 I, I will not fall, 
 I will stand tall 
 Feels like no one can 
 beat me 
  
 When I was just a little baby boy 
 My mamma used to tell me these crazy things 
 She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man 
 She used to tell me he hated me 
 But then I got a little bit older and I realized 
 she was the crazy one 
 And there was nothing I could do or say to change her 
 Cause thats just the way she was 
 They said I cant rap about being broke no more 
 They didnt say I cant rap about coke no more 
 Ahh 
 Slut, you think I wont choke no whore 
 Till her vocal cords dont work in her throat no more 
 Ahh 
 These motherfuckers are thinking Im playin 
 Thinking Im sayin this shit cause Im thinkin it 
 Just to be sayin it 
 Ahh 
 Put your hands down bitch I aint gon shoot you 
 Imma pull you to this bullet and put it through you 
 Ahh 
 Shut up, slut youre causing too much chaos 
 Just bend over and take it like a slut, ok ma 
 Oh, now hes raping his own mother, abusing her 
 Worse snortin coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover? 
 Youre goddamn right bitch, and now its too late 
 Im triple-platnum and tragedies happened in two states 
 I invented violence you vile, venomous, vomital bitches 
 Vain, vicadin, vrin-vrin-vrin 
 Touch this chainsaw, left his brains all 
 Dangling from his neck while his head barely hangs on 
 Blood, guts, guns, cuts 
 Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts 
 Bitch, Imma kill you 
 You dont wanna fuck with me 
 Girls leave, you aint nothin but a slut to me 
 Bitch, Imma kill you 
 You dont got the balls to beef 
 We aint gon never stop beefin 
 I dont squash the beef 
 You better kill me 
 Imma be another rapper dead 
 For poppin off at the mouth with shit I shouldnt have said 
 But when they kill me 
 Im bringin the world with me 
 Bitches too, you aint nothin but a girl to me 
 I said you dont wanna fuck with Shady 
 Cause why? 
 Cause Shady will fuckin kill you 
 Ha-ha 
 You dont wanna fuck with Shady 
 Why? 
 Cause Shady will fuckin kill you 
 Bitch, Imma kill you 
 Like a murder weapon Imma conceal you 
 In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows & film you 
 Fuck with me, Ive been through hell, shut the hell up 
 Im try-na to develop these pictures of the devil to sell them 
 I aint Acid Rap but I rap on acid 
 Got a new blow torch and just had a strap-on added 
 Woops, is that a subliminal hint? No! 
 Its criminal intent, to sodomize women again 
 Eminem offend? No, Eminemll assault 
 And if you ever give it to him youll give him an impulse 
 To do it again, then if he does it again 
 You probabaly end up jumping out of something up in the tents 
 Bitch, Imma kill you 
 I aint done, this aint the chorus 
 I aint even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest 
 A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times 
 In a tub but thats normal aint it Norman? 
 Serial killer hiding murder material 
 In a cereal box on top of your stereo 
 Here we go again, were out of out medicine Out of our minds, 
 and we want in yours Let us in 
 Or Imma kill you 
 You dont wanna fuck with me 
 Girls leave, you aint nothin but a slut to me 
 Bitch, Imma kill you 
 You dont got the balls to beef 
 We aint gon never stop beefin 
 I dont squash the beef 
 You better kill me 
 Imma be another rapper dead 
 For poppin off at the mouth with shit I shouldnt have said 
 But when they kill me 
 Im bringin the world with me 
 Bitches too, you aint nothin but a girl to me 
 I said you dont wanna fuck with Shady 
 Cause why? 
 Cause Shady will fuckin kill you 
 Ha-ha 
 You dont wanna fuck with Shady 
 Why? 
 Cause Shady will fuckin kill you 
 He-heh 
 Know why I say these things 
 Cause ladies screams be creepin in Shadys dreams 
 And the way things seem, I shouldnt have to pay these shrinks 
 These eighty gs so he can say the same things tweece 
 Twice, whatever, I hate these things 
 Fuck shots, I hope this weedll outweigh these drinks 
 Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows 
 Just to argue with them cause their ratings stink? 
 Fuck that, Ill choke radio announcer to bouncer 
 From that bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her 
 From the princapal to student body and counseler 
 From in school to before school to outta school 
 I dont even believe in breathin 
 Im leavin air in your lungs so you can keep screamin 
 For me to seep it 
 Okay, Im ready to go play

 Some deny and search for things that never come around 
 Do I feel like a fool? 
 The places I have ran to all my life have disappeared 
 And I owe this all to you 
 Im feeling like Im sinking 
 And nothings there to catch me, keep me breathing 
 What do I have to do? 
 Why cant this hurt be through? 
 Im going head unto 
 Something I know I will fail 
 Why cant this kiss be true 
 Why wont you please let me through? 
 I dont understand why you always push me away 
 The last thing I would like to do before I go away 
 Is cry there next to you next to you 
 Cry and talk about the good old days and where theyve gone 
 And now how much I hate you 
 What do I have to do? 
 Why cant this hurt be through? 
 Im going head unto 
 Something I know I will fail 
 Why cant this kiss be true

 The situation gets rough, and I start to panic 
 Its not enough, its just a habit 
 And, kid, youre sick

 And five, five, five for my lonely 
 And six, six, six for my sorrow 
 And seven, seven for no tomorrow

 There was christ in the metal shell 
 There was blood on the pavement 
 The camera will make you God 
 Until jack becomes sainted 
  
 If you die when theres no one watching 
 And your ratings drop and your forgotten 
 If they kill you on their TV 
 Youre a martyr in the Lamb of God 
 Nothings gunna change 
 Nothings gunna change the world 
  
 There was Lennon in the happy gun 
 There were ruds on the pavement 
 We were looking for the Lamb of God 
 We were looking for our David 
  
 If you die when theres no one watching 
 And your ratings drop and your forgotten 
 Did they kill you on their TV 
 Youre a martyr in the Lamb of God 
 Nothings gunna change the world 
 Nothings gunna change 
 Nothings gunna change the world 
 Nothings gunna change the world 
  
 It took three days for him to die 
 The born again to buy the serial rights 
 Lamb of God have mercy on us 
 Lamb of God would you grant us? 
 Nothings gunna change the world 
 Nothings gunna change

 If you die when theres no one watching 
 And your ratings drop and your forgotten 
 If they kill you on their TV 
 Youre a martyr in the Lamb of God 
 Nothings gunna change the world 
 Spineless from the start, sucked into the part 
 Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown 
 Please, please 
 Spreading his disease, living by his story 
 Knees, knees 
 Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory 
 You will 
  
 Time for lust, time for lie 
 Time to kiss your life goodbye 
 Send me money, send me green 
 Heaven you will meet 
 Make a contribution 
 And youll get a better seat 
 Bow to Leper Messiah 
  
 Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix 
 Blind devotion came, rotting your brain 
 Chain, chain 
 Join the endless chain, taken by his glamour 
 Fame, Fame 
 Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power 
 We see 
 Time for lust, time for lie 
 Time to kiss your life goodbye 
 Send me money, send me green 
 Heaven you will meet 
 Make a contribution 
 And youll get a better seat 
 Bow to Leper Messiah 
  
 Witchery, weakening 
 Sees the sheep are gathering 
 Set the trap, hypnotize 
 Now you follow 
  
 Time for lust, time for lie 
 Time to kiss your life goodbye 
 Send me money, send me green 
 Heaven you will meet 
 Make a contribution 
 And youll get a better seat 
 Lie,lie ,lie,lie,lie,lie,lie,lie 
 I think I might be a fortune teller 
 I read your face just like a letter 
 The funny thing about forever 
 Is it comes with a side of never never 
 I cant buy into what youre selling 
 And no its not that I dont want it 
 Believe me I love to close my eyes, enjoy the ride 
 But youve made a bad decision and I 
  
 I know, I know, I know, 
 I know, I know, I know 
  
 Youre only gonna let me down 
 When it counts, you countdown 
 Youre only gonna turn me out 
 As I burn, you burn out 
 Youre only gonna make me feel so crazy 
 But when I think we could be something 
 You go and let me down, let me down, oh 
  
 I am too smart to let you in here 
 But Im just dumb enough to linger 
 I wanna think that youll be different 
 Smoking mirrors are so clever clever 
 I picked him and things went so bad 
 Then what you say wont actually happen 
 Ive been dying to open my eyes 
 See you try instead of always leaving me out to dry 
  
 Youre only gonna let me down 
 When it counts, you countdown 
 Youre only gonna turn me out 
 As I burn, you burn out 
 Youre only gonna make me feel so crazy 
 But when I think we could be something 
 You go and let me down, let me down, oh 
  
 I need i need  to be there when you say youre gonna be 
 I care I care to much and you care enough to leave 
 I want I want some place to rest my head without waiting 
 Its not fair, Its not fair, Its not fair, Its not fair 
 Its not fair to me, cause I know by now 
 Youre only gonna let me down 
 When it counts, you countdown 
 Youre only gonna turn me out 
 As I burn, you burn out 
 Youre only gonna make me feel so crazy 
 But when I think we could be something 
 You go and let me down, let me down 
  
 Youre only gonna let me down 
 When it counts, you countdown 
 Youre only gonna turn me out 
 As I burn, you burn out 
 Youre only gonna make me feel so crazy 
 But when I think we could be something 
 You go and let me down, let me down, oh 
  
 Stripped of life, alone 
 In the midst of something that I 
 Want to play with your evil inside 
 Wanting, letting go 
 Of what never could be again 
 Lost and alone 
 Imprisoned now inside your mind 
 With the way you tried to destroy me again 
 You were waiting and living for no one 
 With the way you tried 
 To completely refuse all your life 
 Feed on your nothing 
 Youll never live up to me 
  
 Awaken you 
 With a little evil inside 
 Feed on your nothing 
 Youll never live up to me 
 Ive stricken you 
 I dont want to live with the lie 
 Feed on your nothing 
 And youll never live up to me 
  
 Awaken you, you know 
 Cant live up to me

 Cant live up to me 
  
 There isnt a thing that I can do 
 Watching this whole thing just wash away 
 Making me long 
 There isnt a thing that I can do 
 Watching this whole thing just wash away 
 Making me long 
 Making you strong 
  
 Awaken you 
 With a little evil inside 
 Feed on your nothing 
 Youll never live up to me 
 Ive stricken you 
 I dont want to live with the lie 
 Feed on your nothing 
 And youll never live up to me

 Step by step, heart to heart, left right left 
 We all fall down 
  
 Step by step, heart to heart, left right left 
 We all fall down like toy soldiers 
 Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win 
 But the battle wages on for toy soldiers 
  
 Im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure 
 Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders 
 I am never supposed to show it, my crew aint supposed to know it 
 Even if it means goin toe to toe with a Benzino it dont matter 
 Id never drag them in battles 
 that I can handle unless I absolutely have to 
 Im supposed to set an example 
 I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide em 
 If some shit ever just pop off, Im supposed to be beside em 
 Now Ja said "I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it" 
 Theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it 
 I heard him say Hailies name on a song and I just lost it 
 It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit 
 And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it 
 I spent too much energy on it, honestly Im exhausted 
 And Im so caught in it I almost feel Im the one who caused it 
 This aint what Im in hip-hop for, its not why I got in it 
 That was never my object for someone to get killed 
 Why would I wanna destroy something I help build 
 It wasnt my intentions, my intentions was good 
 I went through my whole career without ever mentionin ? 
 Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasnt my beef 
 So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth 
 While hes all over tv down talkin a man who literally saved my life 
 Like fuck it i understand this is business 
 And this shit just isnt none of my business 
 But still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute cuz 
 Step by step, heart to heart, left right left 
 We all fall down like toy soldiers 
 Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win 
 But the battle wages on for toy soldiers 
  
 There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme 
 And wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin 
 But now its elevated cuz once you put someones kids in it 
 The shit gets escalated, it aint just words no more is it? 
 Its a different ball game, callin names and you aint just rappin 
 We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin 
 Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him 
 And asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him 
 Until Ja started yappin in magazines how we stabbed him 
 Fuck it 50 smash em, mash em and let him have it 
 Meanwhile my attention is pullin in other directions 
 Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk 
 Has an erection for me and thinks that Ill be his ressurection 
 Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record 
 But now hes fucked the game up cuz one of the ways I came up 
 Was through that publication the same one that made me famous 
 Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin 
 Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then 
 But Im so busy being pissed off I dont stop to think 
 That we just inherited 50s beef with Murder Inc 
 And hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind 
 We still have soldiers thats on the front line 
 Thats willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders 
 Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us 
 Well maybe shout em out in a rap or up in a chorus 
 To show them we love em back and let em know how important it is 
 To have run ya nav and who sulked us up in our corners 
 Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is 
 But I aint tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered 
 There aint words that I cant think of a perfecter way to word it 
 Then to just say that I love yall too much to see the virdict 
 Ill walk away from it all before I let it go any further 
 But dont get it twisted, its not a plea that Im coppin 
 Im just willin to be the bigger man 
 If yall can quit poppin off at your jaws with the knockin 
 Cuz frankly Im sick of talkin 
 Im not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cuz 
 Step by step, heart to heart, left right left 
 We all fall down like toy soldiers 
 Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win 
 But the battle wages on for toy soldiers 
 01:3114You cant sleep, youre restless 
 and slightly obsessed with falling too deep 
 and malfunction, youre a virus 
 whos intention is fucking up something 
 Youre a crater 
 on the face of a problem much greater 
 Its the violence, or lack thereof control 
 Body and soul, digging a hole 
 Is the blood stainless? 
 Enjoy the pain with accepting your grief 
 Are you finished? 
 Dumb fucking question, dont let yourself fall asleep 
 Ressurect the intention 
 Once your vision is now mass-produced, 
 Imagine the insults a blessing 
 imagine accepting the truth 
  
 Imagine accepting the truth 
 Imagine accepting the truth 
 Imagine accepting the truth 
 Just imagine accepting the truth 
 Imagine accepting the truth 
  
 The pendulum swinging 
 Hypnosis has taken control, now you linger 
 on a shadow of a doubt 
 Have you really figured what youre all about? 
 Dont trust your instincts 
 Just open the chamber where you keep those darkest regrets 
 All the things youve done wrong 
 Rebellious at heart all along 
 Is your leader a voice? 
 Somehow you replaced all your game with a debt 
 Now the paybacks a bitch 
 Why owe your life to a bitch? 
 Absolutely pathetic 
 and regret it when told you are made of mistakes 
 Imagine the insults a blessing 
 imagine accepting the truth 
  
 Imagine accepting the truth 
 Imagine accepting the truth 
 Imagine accepting the truth 
 Imagine accepting the truth 
 Imagine accepting the truth 
  
 Now speak to your leader! 
 Now speak to your leader! 
  
 Your father who art in heaven 
 Hallowed be thy name, 
 deliver us from evil, deliver us from evil 
 Your father who art in heaven 
 Hallowed be thy name, 
 deliver us from evil, deliver us from evil 
 Our father who art in heaven 
 Hallowed be thy name, 
 deliver me from evil, deliver me from evil 
 Our father who art in heaven 
 Hallowed be thy name, 
 deliver me from evil, deliver me from evil 
  
 Imagine accepting the truth 
 Imagine accepting the truth 
 Imagine accepting the truth 
 Imagine accepting the truth 
 Imagine accepting the truth 
  
 If heaven is a place where the angels go, 
 Well then Ive got a story to tell, 
 If heaven is a place where the angels go, 
 Then I guess youre going straight to hell! 
  
 Dont wanna leave you no never, 
 Cause were perfect together, 
 Never wanna be apart, 
  
 Dared to take on the simple life 
 There was trouble for us when I came home early, 
 Never would expect to see this, 
 Its fair to say "Couldnt believe my eyes" 
  
 You cracked a smile but had nothing to say, 
 So I made a list of on how youre going to pay! 
  
 I Locked you out, left you naked in the front yard, 
 Burned all of your clothes, having nothing can be really hard 
 Now Im on the run, 
 Id do it all again, 
 So Catch me if you can, 
 Cause, I took your car, 
 With your baby in the back seat, 
 Wracked your credit card, 
 Your in debt to deadbeat, 
 Maybe now you know how much it hurt, 
 When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a Little Smirk! 
  
 Now I feel better, but its hard to forget, 
 I never think about looking back, 
 Cause time has no meaning when your free, 
 This is what you get, 
 Karma bitch, 
 Now I see what you really are, 
 Cause happiness is the best revenge, 
  
 Caught red handed with a grin on your face, 
 Didnt think youd be easy to replace! 
 I Locked you out, left you naked in the front yard, 
 Burned all of your clothes, having nothing can be really hard, 
 Now Im on the run, 
 Id do it all again, 
 So Catch me if you can, 
 Cause, I took your car, 
 With your baby in the back seat, 
 Wracked your credit card, 
 Your in debt to a deadbeat, 
 Maybe now you know how much it hurt, 
 When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a Little Smirk! 
  
 Again and again and again and again and e-yeah 
 If heaven is a place where the angels go, 
 Well then Ive got a story to tell, 
 If heaven is a place where the angels go, 
 Then I know Im going straight to hell! 
  
 I Locked you out, left you naked in the front yard,

 Wearing nothing but a Little Smirk! 
  
 Look if you had one shot one opportunity 
 To seize everything you ever wantedOne moment 
 Would you capture it or just let it slip? 
  
 His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy 
 Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti 
 Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
 To drop bombs but he keeps on forgettin 
 What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud 
 He opens his mouth but the words wonte out 
 Hes chokin how everybodys jokin now 
 The clocks run out times up over bloah! 
 Snap back to reality Oh there goes gravity 
 Oh there goes Rabbit he choked 
 Hes so mad but he wont give up that 
 Is he? No 
 He wont have it  he knows his whole back citys ropes 
 It dont matter hes dope 
 He knows that but hes broke 
 Hes so stacked that he knows 
 When he goes back to his mobile home thats when its 
 Back to the lab again yo 
 This whole rap shit 
 He better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him 
 You better lose yourself in the music the moment 
 You own it you better never let it go 
 You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
 This opportunityes once in a lifetime yo 
 You better lose yourself in the music the moment 
 You own it you better never let it go 
 You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
 This opportunityes once in a lifetime yo 
  
 The souls escaping through this hole that its gaping 
 This world is mine for the taking 
 Make me king as we move toward a new world order 
 A normal life is borin but superstardoms close to post mortar 
 It only grows harder only grows hotter 
 He blows us all over these hoes is all on him 
 Coast to coast shows hes know as the globetrotter 
 Lonely roads God only knows 
 Hes grown farther from home hes no father 
 He goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
 But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water 
 His bosses dont want him no mo hes cold product 
 They moved on to the next schmoe who flows 
 He nose dove and sold nada 
 So the soap opera is told and unfolds 
 I suppose its old potna but the beat goes on 
 Da da dum da dum da da 
 You better lose yourself in the music the moment 
 You own it you better never let it go 
 You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
 This opportunityes once in a lifetime yo 
 You better lose yourself in the music the moment 
 You own it you better never let it go 
 You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
 This opportunityes once in a lifetime yo 
  
 No more games Ima change what you call rage 
 Tear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged 
 I was playin in the beginnin the mood all changed 
 I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
 But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher 
 Best believe somebodys payin the pied piper 
 All the pain inside amplified by the fact 
 That I cant get by with my 9 to 5 
 And I cant provide the right type of life for my family 
 Cuz man these goddam food stamps dont buy diapers 
 And its no movie theres no Mekhi Phifer this is my life 
 And these times are so hard and its getting even harder 
 Tryin to feed and water my seed plus 
 See dishonor caught up bein a father and a prima donna 
 Baby mama dramas screamin on and 
 Too much for me to wanna 
 Stay in one spot another jam or not 
 Has gotten me to the point Im like a snail 
 Ive got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot 
 Success is my only mothafuckin option failures not 
 Mom I love you but this trail has got to go 
 I cannot grow old in Salems lot 
 So here I go is my shot 
 Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got 
 You better lose yourself in the music the moment 
 You own it you better never let it go 
 You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
 This opportunityes once in a lifetime yo 
 You better lose yourself in the music the moment 
 You own it you better never let it go 
 You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow

 Yo, you might see me jogging, you might see me walking 
 You might see me walking a dead rottweiler dog 
 with its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar 
 hollerin at him cause the son of a bitch wont quit barkin 
 grrrr, ARF ARF Or leanin out a window, with a cocked shotgun 
 Drivin up the block in the car that they shot Pac in 
 Lookin for Bigs killers, dressed in ridiculous

 Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace 
 Pissed off, cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this 
 Watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off em 
 and get dollars that shoulda been theres like they switched wallets 
 And amidst all this Crist poppin and wristwatches 
 I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous 
 and walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin 
 startin shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman "God damnit!" 
 Im anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin 
 with instincts to kill NSync, dont get me started 
 These fuckin brats cant sing and Britneys garbage 
 Whats this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars 
 All I see is sissies in magazines smiling 
 Whatever happened to whylin out and bein violent? 
 Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol fashioned 
 passionate ass-whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken? 
 New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick 
 Boy/girl groups make me sick 
 And I cant wait til I catch all you faggots in public

 A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me 
 and run around screamin, "I dont care, just bite me" nah nah 
 I think I was put here to annoy the world 
 and destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl 
 Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer 
 and call themselves "Clowns" cause they look queer 
 Faggot2Dope and Silent Gay 
 Claimin Detroit, when yall live twenty miles away fuckin punks 
 And I dont wrestle, Ill knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out 
 Ask em about the club they was at when they snuck out 
 after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out 
 AHHH! Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow! 
 Look at yall running your mouth again 
 when you aint seen a fucking Mile Road, South of 10 
 And I dont need help, from D-12, to beat up two females 
 in make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails 
 "Slim Anus," you damn right, Slim Anus 
 I dont get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots! 
  
  
 Cause Im, just Marshall Mathers Marshall Mathers 
 Im not a wrestler guy, 
 Ill knock you out if you talk about me you talk about me 
 Come and see me on the streets alone 
 if you assholes doubt me assholes doubt me 
 And if you wanna run your mouth 
 then come take your best shot at me your best shot at me 
  
  
 Is it because you love me that yall expect so much of me? 
 You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy 
 Now because of this blonde mop thats on top 
 and this fucked up head that Ive got, Ive gone pop? 
 The underground just spunned around and did a 360 
 Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies 
 "Oh, he just did some shit with Missy, 
 so now he thinks hes too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy" 
 My fuckin bitch moms suin for ten million 
 She must want a dollar for every pill Ive been stealin 
 Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit? 
 All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress 
 Which is it bitch, Mrs Briggs or Ms Mathers? 
 It doesnt matter your attorney Fred Gibsons a faggot! 
 Talkin about I fabricated my past 
 Hes just aggravated I wont ejaculate in his ass Uhh! 
 So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do? 
 For every million I make, another relative sues 
 Family fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper 
 All the sudden, I got 90 some cousins Hey its me! 
 A half-brother and sister who never seen me 
 or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV 
 Now everybodys so happy and proud 
 Im finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriends house 
 Hey-hey! And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand 
 to buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp 
 Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast 
 and what do I see? A picture of my big white ass 
 Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help:

 Now your magazine shouldnt have so much trouble to sell 
 Ahh fuck it, Ill even buy a couple myself

 and try to take shots at me take shots at me 
 You see Im, just Marshall Mathers Marshall Mathers

 Now everybody wanna run they mouth 
 and try to take shots at me take shots at me 
 End of passion play, crumbling away 
 Im your source of self-destruction 
 Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear 
 Leading on your deaths construction 
  
 Taste me you will see

 Youre dedicated to 
 How Im killing you 
  
 Come crawling faster 
 Obey your Master 
 Your life burns faster

 Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams 
 Blinded by me, you cant see a thing 
 Just call my name, `cause Ill hear you scream 
 Master, master 
 Just call my name, `cause Ill hear you scream 
 Master, master 
  
 Needlework the way, never you betray 
 life of death becoming clearer 
 Pain monopoly, ritual misery 
 Chop your breakfast on a mirror 
  
 Taste me you will see 
 More is all you need 
 Ooure dedicated to 
 How Im killing you 
  
 Come crawling faster 
 Obey your Master 
 Your life burns faster

 Master, master 
  
 Master, Master, Wheres the dreams that Ive been after? 
 Master, Master, You promised only lies 
 Laughter, Laughter, All I hear and see is laughter 
 Laughter, Laughter, laughing at my cries 
  
 Hell is worth all that, natural habitat 
 Just a rhyme without a reason 
 Neverending maze, drift on numbered days 
 Now your life is out of season 
  
 I will occupy 
 I will help you die 
 I will run through you 
 Now i rule you too 
  
 Come crawling faster 
 Obey your Master

 I am strong but I break 
 I am stubborn 
 And I make plenty of mistakes 
 Yeah I am hard 
 And life with me is never easy 
 To figure out, to love 
 I am jaded but oh so lovely 
 All you have to do is hold me 
 And you will know and you will see 
 just how sweet it can be 
 If you will trust me, 
 love me, let me 
 01:0075Maybe, maybe 
 Someday 
 When were at the same place 
 When were on the same road 
 When its okay to hold my hand 
 Without feeling lost 
 Without all the excuses 
 When its just because you love me, 
 you let me, you need me 
 Then maybe, maybe 
 All you have to do is hold me 
 And you will know and you will see just 
 how sweet it can be 
 If you will trust me, love me, let me 
 I am confusing as hell 
 I am north and south 
 And Ill probably never have it all figured out 
 But what I know is I wasnt meant 
 to walk this world without you 
 And I promise Ill try 
 Yeah I am gonna try to give you 
 every little part of me 
 Every single detail you missed with your eyes 
 Then maybe 
 Maybe, yeah maybe 
 One day 
 Well meet again and you will need me, 
 you will see me completely 
 Every little bit 
 Oh yeah maybe you will love me, 
 you will love me then 
 I dont want to be tough 
 And I dont want to be proud 
 I dont need to be fixed and I certainly 
 dont need to be found 
 I am not lost 
 I need to be loved 
 I just need to be loved 
 I just want to be loved by you and I 
 wont stop cause I believe 
 That maybe, yeah maybe 
 Maybe, yeah maybe 
 03:5134Maybe 
  
 I should know better than 
 to touch the fire twice 
 But I am thinking maybe, 
 yeah maybe you might 
 Maybe, love maybe 
 Whats the difference of never knowing at all? 
 When every step I take is always too small 
 Maybe its just something I cant admit but lately, 
 I feel like I dont give a shit 
 Motivation such an aggravation, 
 Accusations dont know how to take them 
 Inspirations getting hard to fake it 
 Concentrations never hard to brake it 
 Situation never what you want it to be 
 Whats the point of never making mistakes? 
 Self-indulgence is such a hard habit to brake 
 Its all just a waste of time in the end 
 I dont care so why should I even pretend 
 Motivation such an aggravation, 
 Accusations dont know how to take them 
 Inspirations getting hard to fake it 
 Concentrations never hard to brake it 
 Situation never what you want it 
 Nothings new, everythings the same 
 It keeps on dragging me down, its getting kind of lame 
 Im falling further behind, theres nothing to explain 
 No matter what you say nothing s gonna change my mind 
 Cant pretend on doubt until the end 
 It seems like leaving friends has become 
 This years trend and though I cant pretend 
 Its not the same but whos to blame, 
 or all those stupid things I never said 
 Motivation such an aggravation, 
 Accusations dont know how to take them 
 Inspirations getting hard to fake it 
 Concentrations never hard to brake it 
 Motivation such an aggravation, 
 Accusations dont know how to take them 
 Inspirations getting hard to fake it 
 Concentrations never hard to brake it 
 Situation never what you want it to be 
  
 Never what you want it to be 
 Never what you want it to be 
 Ira Hayes  Ira Hayes Call him drunken Ira Hayes 
 He wont answer anymore 
 Not the whiskey drinkin Indian 
 Nor the Marine that went to war 
  
 Gather round me people theres a story I would tell 
  
 About a brave young Indian you should remember well 
 From the tribe of the Pima Indian 
 A proud and peaceful band 
 Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land 
 Down the ditches for a thousand years 
 The water grew Iras peoples crops 
 Till the white man stole the water rights 
 And the sparklin water stopped 
 Now Iras folks were hungry 
 And their land grew crops of weeds 
 When war came, Ira volunteered 
 And forgot the white mans greed 
 Call him drunken Ira Hayes 
 He wont answer anymore 
 Not the whiskey drinkin Indian 
 Nor the Marine that went to war 
  
 There they battled up Iwo Jimas hill, 
 Two hundred and fifty men 
 But only twenty-seven lived to fight back down again 
 And when the fight was over 
 And when Old Glory raised 
 Among the men who held it high 
 Was the Indian, Ira Hayes 
  
 Call him drunken Ira Hayes 
 He wont answer anymore 
 Not the whiskey drinkin Indian 
 Nor the Marine that went to war 
  
 Ira returned a hero 
 Celebrated through the land 
 He was wined and speeched and honored; 
 Everybody shook his hand 
 But he was just a Pima Indian 
 No water, no crops, no chance 
 At home nobody cared what Irad done 
 And when did the Indians dance 
  
 Call him drunken Ira Hayes 
 He wont answer anymore 
 Not the whiskey drinkin Indian 
 Nor the Marine that went to war 
  
 Then Ira started drinkin hard; 
  
 Jail was often his home 
 Theyd let him raise the flag and lower it 
 like youd throw a dog a bone! 
  
 He died drunk early one mornin 
 Alone in the land he fought to save 
 Two inches of water in a lonely ditch 
 Was a grave for Ira Hayes 
  
 Call him drunken Ira Hayes 
 He wont answer anymore 
 Not the whiskey drinkin Indian 
 Nor the Marine that went to war 
  
 Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes 
  
 But his land is just as dry 
 And his ghost is lyin thirsty 
 In the ditch where Ira died 
 Living and dying laughing and crying 
 Once you have seen it you will never be the same 
 Life in the fast lane is just how it seems 
 Hard and it is heavy dirty and mean 
 Motorbreath 
 Its how I live my life 
 I cant take it any other way 
 Motorbreath 
 The sign of living fast 
 It is going to take 
 Your breath away 
 Dont stop for nothing its full speed or nothing 
 I am taking down you know whatever is in my way 
 Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line 
 Sending the shivers up and down your spine 
 Motorbreath 
 Its how I live my life 
 I cant take it any other way 
 Motorbreath 
 The sign of living fast 
 It is going to take 
 Your breath away 
 Those people who tell you not to take chances 
 They are all missing on what life is about 
 You only live once so take hold of the chance 
 Dont end up like others the same song and dance 
 Motorbreath 
 Its how I live my life 
 I cant take it any other way 
 Motorbreath 
 The sign of living fast 
 It is going to take 
 Your breath away 
 Well you think you know it all

 So you take it down, another pill to swallow 
 Mr Bring Me Down

 Yo, yeah girl, 
 Can you hear that? Its playing our song 
 Are you sleepy? Take a nap 
 Youre not afraid of the dark? Are you? 
  
 You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to sleep 
 I knock on Dakotas door, its locked so I go to creep 
 round the back, with binoculars, not cause I wanna peep 
 But because Im hungry she smells like tacos I wanna eat 
 Visions of hot chocolatey marshmallows all so sweet 
 With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall hes on your street 
 Hes placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet 
 Now walk on em, hes dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek 
 Like a Thanksgiving turkey, or holiday ham 
 Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam 
 Flavor my favorite graham crackers with John Bennet Rams 
 I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am 
  
 Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep My music box 
 But I can hear my luck keep calling me My music box 
 When were worlds apart, you mean the world to me My music box 
 ? I will answer My music box 
  
 Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep My music box 
 I hear my music box, playing a song for me My music box 
 So when she twirls around do a whirl for me My music box 
 ? My music box 
  
 I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober gross 
 I foam like a Doberman, mouth open I overdose 
 Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug my nose 
 My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know 
 I put on my mothers make up, get naked and run around 
 Wavin the gun around, I think Im down to a hundred pounds 
 Theres thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out 
 The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin it out 
 I must be buggin the f-ck out, but what the f-ck about? 
 Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house 
 They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box 
 Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, its locked 
 I pick it and open it but its stuffed full of human parts 
 I dig till I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts 
 Its playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark 
 The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess Ill loom in the park 
  
 Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep My music box 
 But I can hear my luck keep calling me My music box 
 When were worlds apart, you mean the world to me My music box 
 ? I will answer My music box 
  
 Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep My music box 
 But I can hear my luck keep calling me My music box 
 When were worlds apart, you mean the world to me My music box 
 ? I will answer My music box 
  
 Im fixated on asphyxiating and breakin this little chicks 
 Neck like a pixie stick 
 The sick Satan worshippin, bitches get horse-whippins, 
 Im in the back, through the back door, slip in 
 Through the crack leavin the corpse drippin 
 The mortician of love, sent from above, 
 forced and treat em all 
 stingy Ive become 
 Been doin this for more than a quarter century, Im just numb 
 Am I dreamin, is it real Someone pinch me on the buns 
 The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder 
 Id had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her 
 then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her 
 with the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her 
 But before I do that, Ill have a chat to flatter her 
 Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha 
 Im your secret admirer, Im back to ravish ya 
 So strong is your fight, but your no match for Dracula 
 Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin her 
 Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her 
 Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera 
 Stand back, cuz here comes your man Jack, so Pamela 
  
 Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep My music box 
 But I can hear my luck keep calling me My music box 
 When were worlds apart, you mean the world to me My music box 
 ? I will answer My music box

 Yeah, yeah

 A city that seems so jaded 
 I cant, I cant end up like that 
  
 Its all about what youre driving you know

 So fast just like that, youre way off track 
  
 To all you 
 Who want to 
 You want to it just aint worth it 
 To all you 
 Who need to 
 You need to know 
 I dont give a fuck that you cant stand me 
 Ive finally had enough of what youre sayin

 Youre my derailment 
 So sick and 
 So shameless 
 So Id never stop by saying 
 Do you know, you know, who I am 
  
 Its not about what youre driving you know 
 Cause when its gone youll be standing alone 
 So fast, just like that 
 You turned your back

 Youre my derailment 
 Its funny how you lie and try to wreck me

 Youre my derailment 
  
 Where do we go from here 
 If everythings so unclear 
 Too late to be back for my lonely 
 She,too late to turn back time 
 Ill never make it out alive 
 Until the day I see through all your lies 
  
 Guess this means youre sorry 
 Youre standing at my door 
 Guess this means you take back 
 All you said before 
 Like how much you wanted 
 Anyone but me 
 Said youd never come back 
 But here you are again 
  
 Cause we belong together now 
 Forever united here somehow 
 You got a piece of me 
  
 And honestly, 
 My life would suck without you 
 Maybe I was stupid for telling you goodbye 
 Maybe I was wrong for tryin to pick a fight 
 I know that Ive got issues 
 But youre pretty messed up too 
 Either way, I found out Im nothing without you 
 Cause we belong together now 
 Forever united here somehow 
 You got a piece of me 
  
 And honestly, 
 My life would suck without you 
 Being with you 
 Is so disfunctional 
 I really shouldnt miss you 
 But I cant let you go 
 Oh yeah 
  
 Cause we belong together now 
 Forever united here somehow 
 You got a piece of me 
 And honestly, 
 My life would suck without you 
 Cause we belong together 
 Forever united here somehow 
 You got a piece of me 
 And honestly, 
 My life would suck without you 
  
 I hope the ring you gave to her 
 turns her finger green 
 I hope when you re in bed with her 
 You think of me 
 I would never wish bad things 
 But I don t wish you well 
 Could you tell by the flames 
 that burned your words 
  
 I never read your letter 
 Cause I knew what you d say 
 Give me that Sunday school answer 
 Try and make it all ok 
  
 Does it hurt 
 To know I ll never be there 
 Bet it sucks 
 See my face everywhere 
 It was you 
 Who chose to end it like you did 
 I was the last to know 
 You knew 
 Exactly what you would do 
 Don t say 
 You simply lost your way 
 She may believe you but I never will 
 Never again 
  
 If she really knows the truth 
 She deserves you 
 A trophy wife oh how cute 
 Ignorance is bliss 
 But when your day comes 
 and he s through with you 
 And he ll be through with you 
 You ll die together but alone 
  
 You wrote me in a letter 
 You couldn t say it right to my face 
 Give me that Sunday school answer 
 Repent yourself away 
  
 Does it hurt 
 To know I ll never be there 
 Bet it sucks 
 See my face everywhere 
 It was you 
 Who chose to end it like you did 
 I was the last to know 
 You knew 
 Exactly what you would do 
 Don t say 
 You simply lost your way 
 They may believe you but I never will 
 Never again 
  
 Never again will I hear you 
 Never again will I miss you 
 Never again will I fall to you 
 Never 
 Never again will I kiss you 
 Never again will I want to 
 Never again will I love you 
 Never 
  
 Does it hurt 
 To know I ll never be there 
 Bet it sucks 
 See my face everywhere 
 It was you 
 Who chose to end it like you did 
 I was the last to know 
 You knew 
 Exactly what you would do 
 Don t say 
 You simply lost your way 
 They may believe you but I never will 
 I never will 
 I never will 
 Never again 
 00:3036I came into this world as a reject 
 Look into these eyes 
 Then youll see the size of the flames 
 Dwellin on the past 
 Its burnin up my brain 
 Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain 
 Hey, i think about the day 
 My girlie ran away with my pay 
 My fellas came to play 
 Now shes stuck with my homies that she fucked 
 And im just a sucker with a lump in my throat 
 Hey, like a chump, hey--7x

 Should i be fellin good no 
 Its kinda sad 
 Im the laughing stock of the neighborhood 
 And you would think that i would be movin on

 Fucked up in the head, not 
 And maybe she just made a mistake 
 And i should give her a break 
 My heartll ache, either way

 To figure it out 
 But i did it 
 And im the only one 
 Underneath the sun who didnt get it 
 I cant believe that could be decieved

 She put my tender heart in a blender 
 And still i surrendered 
 Hey,like a chump, hey--7x

 Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage 
 One nigga front, my face on the front page 
 Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib 
 One God to show me how to do things his son did 
 Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with 
 151, one sipll make a nigga flip 
 Writin names on my hollow tips, plottin shit 
 Mad violence who Im gon body, this hood politics 
 Ackowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages 
 Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us 
  
 One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up 
 But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again 
 Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken 
 Richochetin between the spots that Im hidin in 
  
 This is my hood Ima rep, to the death of it 
 til everybody come home, little niggaz is grown 
 Hoodrats, dont abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon 
 Sent from the star sun and the moon 
 In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers 
 Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin victims with doctors 
 IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU READY TO DIE, WITH NINES OUT 
 THIS IS WHAT NAS IS BOUT, NIGGA THE TIME IS NOW! 
  
 Yo, all I need is one mic 
 All I need is one mic thats all I need 
 All I need is one mic all I need niggaz 
 All I need is one mic yeah 
  
 All I need is one blunt, one page, and one pen 
 One prayer - tell God forgive me for one sin 
 Matter fact maybe more than one, look back 
 at all the hatred against me, fuck alla them 
 Jesus died at age 33, theres thirty-three shots 
 from twin glocks theres sixteen apiece, thats thirty-two 
 Which means, one of my guns was holdin 17 
 Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you 
 Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral 
 never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent 
 Nothin is fair, niggaz roll up, shootin from wheelchairs 
 My heart is racin, tastin revenge in the air 
 I let the shit slide for too many years, too many times 
 Now Im strapped with a couple of macs, too many nines 
 If yall niggaz really wit me get busy load up the semis 
 Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty 
 Theres nothin in our way - they bust, we bust, they rust, we rust 
 Led flyin, feel it?  I feel it in my gut 
 THAT WE TAKE THESE BITCHES TO WAR, LIE EM DOWN 
 CAUSE WE STRONGER NOW MY NIGGA THE TIME IS NOW!! 
  
 All I need is one mic thats all I need, thats all I need 
 All I need is one mic theres nuttin else in the world 
 All I need is one mic thats all a nigga need to do his thing yknow 
 All I need is one mic 
  
 ALL I NEED IS ONE LIFE, ONE TRY, ONE BREATH IM ONE MAN 
 WHAT I STAND FOR SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, THEY DONT UNDERSTAND 
 Or wanna see me on top, too egotistical 
 Talkin all that slick shit, the same way these bitches do 
 Wonder what my secrets is, niggazll move on you 
 only if they know, what your weakness is I have none 
 Too late to grab guns Im blastin cause Im a cool nigga 
 Thought I wouldnt have that ass done?  Fooled you niggaz 
 What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin 
 War gets deep, some beef is everlastin 
 Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin each other 
 up in prison yards, drama, where does it start? 
 You know the block was ill as a youngster 
 Every night it was like a, cop would get killed body found in the dumpster 
 For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggaz throwin dirt on my name 
 Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain 
 Bitches left me cause they thought I was finished 
 Shoulda knew she wasnt true she came to me when her man caught a sentence 
 Diamonds are blindin, I never make the same mistakes 
 Movin with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight 
 Swellin my melon cause none of these niggaz real 
 Heard he was, tellin police, how can a kingpin squeal? 
 This is crazy, Im on the right track Im finally found 
 You need some soul searchin, the time is now 
  
 All I need is one mic yeah, yeah yeah yeah 
 All I need is one mic thats all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash 
 All I need is one mic fuck the cars, the jewelry 
 All I need is one mic to spread my voice to the whole world 
 Im becoming less defined, as days go by 
 Fading away, well you might say Im losing focus 
 Kinda drifting into the abstract 
 in terms of how I see myself 
  
 Sometimes, I think I can see right through myself 
 Sometimes, I think I can see right through myself 
 Sometimes, I can see right through myself 
  
 Less concerned, about fitting into the world 
 Your world that is, 
 cause it doesnt really matter anymore 
 no, it doesnt really matter anymore 
 No, it doesnt really matter anymore 
 None of this sh really matters anymore 
  
 Yes I am alone but then again I always was 
 As far back as I can tell, 
 I think maybe its because 
 because you were never really real to begin with 
 I just made you up, to hurt myself 
  
 I just made you up to hurt myself 
 Yeah, and I just made you up to hurt myself 
 I just made you up to hurt myself 
 Yeah, and I just made you up to hurt myself 
  
 And it worked 
 Yes it did! 
  
 There is no you, there is only me 
 There is no you, there is only me 
 There is no fucking you, there is only me 
 There is no fucking you, there is only me 
  
 Only 
 Only 
 Only 
 Only 
  
 Well the tiniest little dot caught my eye 
 and it turned out to be a scab 
 And I had this funny feeling, 
 like I just knew its something bad 
  
 I just couldnt leave it alone 
 I cut off that scab 
 It was a doorway trying to seal itself shut 
 But I climbed through 
  
 Now Im somewhere I am not supposed to be 
 And I can see things I know I really shouldnt see 
 And now I know why now, now I know why 
 Things arent as pretty, on the inside 
  
 There is no you, there is only me 
 There is no you, there is only me 
 There is no fucking you, there is only me 
 There is no fucking you, there is only me 
  
 Only 
 Only 
 Only 
 Only 
 Only 
 Only 
 Only 
 Only 
  
 Lashing out the action, returning the reaction 
 Weak are ripped and torn away 
 Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower 
 Battery is here to stay 
 Smashing through the boundaries 
 Lunacy has found me 
 Cannot stop the Battery 
 Pounding out aggression 
 Turns into obsession 
 Cannot kill the Battery 
 Cannot kill the family 
 Battery is found in me 
 Battery,Battery 
  
 Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers 
 Never ending potency 
 Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker 
 Breeding on insanity 
 Smashing through the boundaries 
 Lunacy has found me 
 Cannot stop the Battery 
 Pounding out aggression 
 Turns into obsession 
 Cannot kill the Battery 
 Cannot kill the family 
 Battery is found in me 
 Battery, Battery 
  
 Circle of Destruction, Hammer comes crushing 
 Powerhouse of energy 
 Whipping up a fury, Dominating flurry 
 We create the Battery 
 Smashing through the boundaries 
 Lunacy has found me 
 Cannot stop the Battery 
 Pounding out aggression 
 Turns into obsession 
 Cannot kill the Battery 
 Cannot kill the family 
 Battery is found in me 
 Battery,Battery,Battery,Battery 
  
 You hold me inside your iris 
 a terminal stain on life 
 You condescend to my primal brain 
 and twist me around like a knife 
 Cant begin to explain 
 The feelings I have restrained 
 Dont ask me how I am 
 Because youre too busy planning your epitaph 
 Let me tell you 
 DONT - try to be the ONE - person 
 Who has STAYED - just to say 
 They never left me! 
 Aggravated, complicated, someone say it 
 You keep me hidden behind a curtain, 
 You feed me orchids to give me courage 
 and keep me in line with disdain 
 Cant begin to explain 
 The feelings I have restrained 
 Dont ask me how I am 
 Because youre too busy planning your epitaph 
 Let me tell you 
 DONT - try to be the ONE - person 
 Who has STAYED - just to say 
 They never left me! 
 Aggravated, complicated, someone say it 
 I have nothing left for you 
 you left me with nothing 
 I have nothing left for you 
 I live at arms length and die a little, 
 between your constants by day 
 I want my soul back before its over, 
 I cant even wish you away 
 Cant begin to explain 
 The feelings I have restrained 
 Dont ask me how I am 
 Because youre too busy planning your epitaph 
 Let me tell you 
 DONT - try to be the ONE - person 
 Who has STAYED - just to say 
 They never left me! 
 Aggravated, complicated, someone say it 
 I NEVER LEARN!! 
   
 I see a red door and I want it painted black 
 No colors anymore, I want them to turn black 
 I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes 
 I have to turn my head until my darkness goes 
  
 I see a line of cars and they are painted black 
 With flowers and my love both never to come back 
 I see people turn their heads, they quickly look away 
 Like a new born baby it just happens every day 
  
 I look inside myself and see my heart is black 
 I see my red door and its heading into black 
 Maybe then Ill fade away and not have to face the facts 
 Its not easy facing up when your whole world is black 
 I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black, oh baby 
 I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black, oh baby 
  
 No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue 
 I could not foresee this thing happening to you 
 If I look hard enough into the setting sun 
 My love will laugh with me before the morning comes 
  
 I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black 
 Oh, black as night black as coal 
 I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky 
 Painted, painted, painted black, oh baby 
 Painted, painted, painted black 
  
 Im not sure whos fooling who here 
 As Im watching your decay 
 We both know you could deflate 
 A 7 hurricane 
 Seems like you and your tribe 
 Decided youd rewrite the law 
 Segregate the mind 
 From Body and from soul 
  
 You give me yours 
 Ill give you mine 
 Cause I can look your God 
 Right in the eye 
 You give me yours 
 Ill give you mine 
 You used to look my God 
 Right in the eye 
  
 I believe in defending 
 In what we once 
 Stood for 
 It seems in vogue 
 To be a closet 
 Misogynist homophobe 
 A change of course in 
 Our direction 
 A dash of truth 
 Spread thinly 
 Like a flag 
 On a popstar 
 On a Benzodiazapene 
 You give me yours 
 Ill give you mine 
 Cause I can look your God 
 Right in the eye 
 You give me yours 
 Ill give you mine 
 You used to look my God 
 Right in the eye 
  
 Oh Zion please 
 Remove your glove 
 And dispel every trace 
 Of His spoken word 
 That has lodged 
 In my vortex 
  
 Im not sure whos fooling who here 
 As Im watching your decay 
 We both know you could deflate 
 A 7 hurricane 
 You could have spared 
 Her - oh but no 
 Messiahs need 
 People dying in their Name 
 You could have spared 
 Her - oh but no 
 Messiahs need 
 People dying in their Name 
 You say "I ordered you a pancake" 
  
 You say "I ordered you a pancake" 
  
 I wanna take you baby 
 I wanna take you out 
 I wanna wine and dine you 
 Oh I wanna twist and twist and shout 
 I want you hot in my arms 
 So soft on my bed 
 You get the key to my heart 
 Oh when you wear that sweet dress 
  
 But youre too physical physical to me 
 Youre just too physical physical no to me 
  
 I want your rough house baby 
 I want this right in your ear 
 You let me feel your danger 
 I let you make this feeling clear here 
 I want the touch of your charms 
 The heat of your breath 
 I wanna say all those things 
 That would be better unsaid 
 No 
  
 But youre too physical physical to me 
 Youre just too physical oh 
 Youre too physical for me 
 Youre too physical to me 
 Youre really jus- just too- just 
 Too really fuck no 
  
 Youre just too physical 
 Too fucking physical 
 No 
 Oh youre too physical 
 Pick up the phone 
 Answer your text 
 Well I apologize about last night 
 I really did not mean to disrespect 
  
 You 
 You better be alone 
 No Im not obsessed 
 But if I catch you with somebody else 
 You know that I am gonna be upset 
  
 I truly believe that the reason Im here 
 Is to tell you the truth that your ending is near 
 One day you must look at yourself in mirror 
 I still dont think you are hearing me clear 
 You must understand that our friendship is done 
 Justified by the person that you have become 
 And because of the fact that enough is enough 
 Now the one that is holding the gun! 
  
 Whoa 
 This will be the end of us 
 I have tried way too many times to heal 
 I have loved you so much it hurts me dear 
 And this, this will be the end of us 
  
 Pick up the phone 
 Pick up the phone 
 Pick up the phone 
 Well I apologize about last night 
 I really did not mean to disrespect 
  
  
 Pick yourself up 
 Up off the floor 
 Wipe the tears from off your face 
 Because the cops are knocking on the door 
 Theyre gonna wanna know whats up! 
 Better tell them that you fell 
 Cause when they see the bruises on my face 
 Theyre probably taking both of us to jail 
  
 Im sick and tired of fighting each other 
 The lying, the crying, the calling your mother 
 The calling of names, Im bothered and smothered 
 We kiss and make up, get under the covers 
 A dangerous cycle I dont understand 
 The kicking and screaming, the breaking of limbs 
 Ill be damned if I see you with some other man 
 If I cannot have you, then nobody can 
  
 Whoa 
 This will be the end of us 
 I have tried way too many times to heal 
 I have loved you so much it hurts me dear 
 And this, this will be the end of us 
  
 Death do us part 
 I thought you would never go straight 
 For my heart 
 Im better off living in hell 
  
  
 Pick up your phone 
 Pick up your phone 
 Pick up the phone 
  
 Whoa 
 This will be the end of us 
 I have tried way too many times to heal 
 I have loved you so much it hurts me dear 
 And this, this will be the end of us!

 So watch me strike a match 
 On all my wasted time 
 As far as Im concerned 
 Youre just another picture to burn 
 Theres no time for tears

 Nothing stopping me 
 From going out with all of your best friends 
 And if you come around saying sorry to me 
 My daddys going to show you how sorry youll be 
 Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck 
 You never let me drive

 Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck

 So watch me strike a match

 Theyve got us in the palm of every hand 
 When we pretend that were dead 
 When we pretend that were dead 
 They cant hear a word weve said 
 When we pretend that were dead 
 Turn the tables with our unity 
 They neither moral nor majority 
 Wake up and smell the coffee 
 Or just say no to individuality 
 When we pretend that were dead 
 When we pretend that were dead 
 They cant hear a word weve said 
 When we pretend that were dead 
 Come on, come on, come on come on 
 When we pretend that were dead 
 When we pretend that were dead
